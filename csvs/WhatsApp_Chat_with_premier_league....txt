2019-07-18,12:30,+27 83 740 0625,We tried but he has a choice too. We can only try as much. I am sure Arsenal is also in need of a CB but there can only be one De Leigt. And he chose Juve
2019-07-18,12:30,+27 83 740 0625,As long they come we are okay  Money should be used to buy players

2019-07-18,18:21,Rairo,Yeah lol
2019-07-18,18:22,Doc,Complex outward transfer policies
2019-07-18,18:24,Doc,Perez said whenever they develop interest in a Tototo player he panicks at the thought of their complex negotiating system... those guys are bad
2019-07-18,18:25,+27 81 049 6422,They had such a good foundation
2019-07-18,18:25,+27 81 049 6422,"Why not keep these guys and compete for all trophies available, bring in more players and have a good depth"
2019-07-18,18:26,Doc,Seeing clubs quiet about Harry Kane never think they are not interested in him... they know the process that that have to go thru to sign him
2019-07-18,18:29,Doc,Iye he awaits the contract to come towards its end to give them a transfer ultimatum

2019-07-18,19:39,+263 78 524 8595,"They chose Aurier, they had 2 equally good right backs"
2019-07-18,19:41,+263 78 524 8595,And they have the same problem ku left back ...
2019-07-18,19:42,+27 81 049 6422,"He is a solid player ,but we talking of Tottenham attempting to win a trophy of any sort, they need the numbers , and depth , reason why they fell off in the epl title is coz of fatigue, it doesn't make sense letting those guys go"
2019-07-18,19:42,+27 81 049 6422,Trippier left for 20m 🤷🏿‍♂
2019-07-18,19:46,+263 78 524 8595,"They did not have an option, funds were tied in the stadium Pochettino was forced to work with what he had panguva iyoyo"

2019-08-17,15:30,Rairo,It's comparative on the team level not individual ie he costs maybe £11m if his return per million is less than that of a who costs £9m you have to make sure the £2m you saved is spent on a player with just as much return if not you better off getting Auba for the volume

2019-08-31,11:44,Doc,Analyzing Barkley's game l saw him desperate to shoot against Norwich...  He already feels the threat of the lad and he somehow feels he needs to get scoring or else
2019-08-31,11:46,+27 81 049 6422,"That same thing , ndakazviona , he was taking every opportunity to shoot ,pathat game , and role yaanotamba needs freedom ,pasina kuva under pressure especially when he is not guaranteed to start"

2019-08-31,11:47,Doc,His game needs him to enjoy like he did in October last year under Sarri
2019-08-31,11:48,Doc,The solution is to start him and he needs the Gaffer to assure him bedzi... ongomuti nothing is at stake take your time
2019-08-31,11:53,+27 81 049 6422,"Like Tammy , he needs a game kana an assist or goal bedzi"
2019-08-31,11:53,+27 81 049 6422,Could be a turning point
2019-08-31,11:58,Doc,If he shoots from range and scores that's what he needs for his confidence to soar
2019-08-31,11:59,Doc,Baba Abhurahama vakakanda nhasi then he will  probably be poised for a 15 goal season

2019-09-16,19:35,,"Tavonga: ARSENAL : THE RIDICULOUS STATISTICS * Arsenal have made the highest number of errors (14) that have led to opposition goals in the Premier League since the start of last season. That is three more than Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool combined. OptaJoe @OptaJoe 14 - Since the start of last season, Arsenal's players have made a combined 14 errors leading to opposition goals in the Premier League, at least two more than any other club in this time. Calamitous. 586 6:48 PM - Sep 15, 2019 408 people are talking about this * The Gunners also hold the record for the highest number of errors leading to shots. Their total of 33 is almost double that of Newcastle (17). * No side has conceded more goals from penalties since the start of last season. The Gunners and Brighton have both let in 10 from spot-kicks. * Arsenal have conceded a penalty in each of their last three Premier League matches. * Arsenal allowed Watford – the only Premier League team yet to win a match this season – 31 shots on Sunday, which is the most they have faced since Opta starting gathering such data in 2003-04. * In the second half alone, Watford equalled their record for shots on goal in a single game since they returned to the Premier League in 2015, with 23 of their 31 shots coming after the break. Their previous record for 90 minutes was 23 attempted in games against West Ham, Sunderland and Hull. * Arsenal have now allowed opponents 96 shots on their goal this season – the highest number of any Premier League team . * Arsenal have allowed the same number of shots on their goal (96) this season as Chelsea and Manchester United combined (48 each). * The Gunners faced as many shots on their goal on Sunday at Watford as Manchester City have all season. * Arsenal allowed Watford 48 touches in their box on Sunday, the fourth-highest amount any team has managed in the Premier League this season, and only one touch fewer than Liverpool had against the Gunners last month. * Arsenal have managed the fewest number of shots of any side in the Big Six this season. * No player for any of the Big Six sides has been dribbled past more often than Matteo Guendouzi (10)."

2019-09-22,19:50,Doc,But I told u guys in this group that Ole has no capacity to lead the world's highest valued football club
2019-09-22,19:51,Doc,He is a good coach for ana Everton Watford Leicester etc
2019-09-22,19:51,Doc,Not United haasimudze his leadership lid is low

2019-09-24,10:43,,Tavonga: Team:  Allison (Liverpool/Brazil) Ramos (Real Madrid/Spain) Van Dijk (Liverpool/Netherlands) De Ligt (Ajax/Netherlands) Marcelo (Real Madrid/Brazil) Modric (Real Madrid/Croatia) De Jong (Ajax/Netherlands) Messi (Barcelona/Argentina) Hazard (Chelsea/Belgium) Mbappe (PSG/France) Ronaldo (Juventus/Portugal)
2019-09-24,10:44,Tavonga,That team is a joke.
2019-09-24,10:45,Tavonga,They voted Marcelo ahead of Robertson and trent. Marcelo who lost his place at real Madrid last season. Marcelo who wasnt even in the Brazil team that won the Copas. Robertson nd trent breaking records week in week out.
2019-09-24,10:46,Tavonga,Mbappe ahead of Salah and Mane. Golden boot winners in a league far superior to the French league. Champion league winners. Modric was awful last season.
2019-09-24,10:48,Doc,Marcello 🚮
2019-09-24,10:51,+27 83 740 0625,Standards of everything are dropping

2019-09-24,18:13,Doc,Ole na Mou all have some strikingly wrong traits in them
2019-09-24,18:13,Doc,Mou has expired
2019-09-24,18:14,Doc,Ole lacks the God given things for the position that which Jose has in abundance
2019-09-24,18:14,Doc,I will have none of them
2019-09-24,18:15,+263 71 758 4509,Yaaah bt that article is saying abt Mou's last days
2019-09-24,18:16,Doc,If I were in United's board l would advocate for keep Ole all season and we dont register our displeasure in public whilst we put concrete plans behind the scenes and we release Ole with honour as a man that once served us in the past
2019-09-24,18:17,Doc,Reinventing United for me will take more than just a voach
2019-09-24,18:17,Doc,Coach

2019-09-24,18:19,Doc,All u may do is maybe fire and get a care taker and never get mesmerized by the caretaker like u did with Ole
2019-09-24,18:19,Doc,If Lampard was brought during the season he was gonna be Ole 2.0
2019-09-24,18:22,+27 83 740 0625,Someone in this group was once bullied for defending Mou and attacking the rot at United.
2019-09-24,18:23,,"+263 71 758 4509: Paul Ince: “I think of Ole in the same way as I do Lampard. Two young managers, lacking experience, thrown into two massive clubs. But if you gave me the choice of who I’d rather be watching this season, it’d be Chelsea all day long – and that hurts me as a former United captain""   Ince: “At least when I look at Chelsea, I see what they’re trying to do, the way they play, their identity – they’re pressing high, getting tight, and creating chances. They can only get better. Can anybody tell me what United are trying to do? Because I have no idea."""
2019-09-24,18:24,Doc,Of course I said this
2019-09-24,18:24,Doc,Lampard has what it takes...  ZvaMwari anazvo
2019-09-24,18:25,+27 83 740 0625,"No one knows what type of soccer Ole plays.  All we know he has no spine, just letting go of ""deadwood"" without replacing them. Saying the ""right things"" and averaging 1 point per game.  The sad thing is more than 50% of people who watch and understand soccer predicted United will loose against Westham and what happened."
2019-09-24,18:26,+27 83 740 0625,"Verdict  English United fans might like him, but he is not the right man for the job"
2019-09-24,18:29,Doc,He has everything except that which nobody but only God can give so Ole can never get any better
2019-09-24,20:03,+263 78 524 8595,"Haa we had the worst transfer period .... With defence and james being the only success story , mud going forward zvakafa .... The squad doesnt have depth injuries and out of form players are affecting the team ...."
2019-09-24,20:03,+263 78 524 8595,We both know what a full strength man united XI can do (4-0)
2019-09-24,20:26,+27 83 740 0625,What is a full strength United ?  What football do they play?  Did they play better than Chele on 4-0 ?
2019-09-24,20:26,+27 83 740 0625,We had the most pathetic decisions driven by deluded fans and the class of 92
2019-09-24,20:26,+263 78 524 8595,Did fergie play attractive football ?
2019-09-24,20:27,+27 83 740 0625,Y'all thought the kids were ready
2019-09-24,20:27,+27 83 740 0625,We are past Fergie  During that time city was number 10 at best  Move with the times!!
2019-09-24,20:30,+263 78 524 8595,"Personally i nolonger like Ole but i wont make rational decisions based emotions, we probably have the worst squad but we are rebuilding so im going to give man utd 3 years to have a good squad and challenge for any title"
2019-09-24,20:31,+27 83 740 0625,Ah

2019-09-24,20:33,+263 78 524 8595,You cannot say we want to promote the youth but play young and matic at the same time

2019-09-24,20:34,+263 78 524 8595,Rashford is overrated
2019-09-24,20:35,+27 83 740 0625,We can't play the youth alone
2019-09-24,20:35,+27 83 740 0625,Age is not a formula
2019-09-24,20:37,+27 83 740 0625,Tactics;  Matic is still a good player in his role and he has the calm head.  This agenda of making your experienced players second citizens in the team has no building foundation  Tiago Silvia is 33+years mbappe is 20
2019-09-24,20:38,+263 78 524 8595,Can you really play Young (35) uchisiya A young and Able Dalot ?...kutambisa a slow Matic 34 uchisiya Fred(26) .... Ngati bvumei kuti those players are past their playing days and give the younger generation a chance
2019-09-24,20:38,+27 83 740 0625,Young shouldn't play because he is not good not because he is 35
2019-09-24,20:39,+27 83 740 0625,"Matic is not 34, and carrick retired at 34"
2019-09-24,20:39,+27 83 740 0625,Fred can play over Andreas/ JLings  Those boys are very bad

2019-09-24,20:40,+27 83 740 0625,"Matic has not put a foot wrong, people complain about pace, but pace is not the only thing in footy sadly"
2019-09-24,20:41,+27 83 740 0625,"Iwe Rashy dropped from his former self than Matic  My point is, yes he is aging but McSauce still has a lot to learn from him"
2019-09-24,20:42,+263 78 524 8595,But carrick wasnt playing 90 minutes when he retired kaa he was pa bench

2019-09-24,20:43,+27 83 740 0625,Matic hasn't played 90 min
2019-09-24,20:43,+263 78 524 8595,Is he not a starter
2019-09-24,20:43,+27 83 740 0625,60 his games he started and 20 when he came as a sub
2019-09-24,20:43,+263 78 524 8595,Did he not start last game iro
2019-09-24,20:43,+27 83 740 0625,"He should start at this time of the season, I think"
2019-09-24,20:43,+27 83 740 0625,Lol
2019-09-24,20:44,+27 83 740 0625,He had our first shot on target
2019-09-24,20:44,+27 83 740 0625,Vs Westham
2019-09-24,20:44,+27 83 740 0625,He was captain against Astania
2019-09-24,20:45,+263 78 524 8595,How can you rebuild when you do not have faith in the young players
2019-09-24,20:45,+263 71 758 4509,Man U haisi academy
2019-09-24,20:45,+27 83 740 0625,We can't play ALL young players that's my point
2019-09-24,20:45,+27 83 740 0625,Even Liverpool during its rebuild did not do that
2019-09-24,20:46,+27 83 740 0625,We have the second youngest team so far how young should we go ? 🤷🏾‍♂
2019-09-24,20:46,+27 83 740 0625,🔥👏🏾
2019-09-24,20:47,+263 78 524 8595,Ini i respect Lampard he is doing a good job uya giving youth a chance ... Abraham is playing and Giroud aripa bench be experience yake.... Mount is doing well.... Tomori .... Reece james ....odoi
2019-09-24,20:47,+27 83 740 0625,"We played young CR7 and he left for Madrid, what's our plan with the academy you want us to build ? 🤷🏾‍♂"
2019-09-24,20:47,+27 83 740 0625,"He has no choice,"
2019-09-24,20:47,+27 83 740 0625,Giroud is not as good but very important
2019-09-24,20:48,+263 78 524 8595,Do not play Matic and young when you have better players pa bench ... Those players vapera akusisina they used to be good but apachisisina
2019-09-24,20:48,+27 83 740 0625,Which other player played for him if he had a choice ?

2019-10-24,06:06,Doc,Lampard is a leader and is backed by a strong back room staff not to mention how he has managed to integrate the junior teams technical department into the main squad to make one big team
2019-10-24,06:10,+27 81 049 6422,And that squad is too strong. An issue that is highly undermined coz of that ban

2019-10-24,06:16,Doc,Where we have goal scorers from everywhere on the pitch and reliance is no longer on one player such that people come off the bench and unsettle the opponent and score goals... that's depth ..
2019-10-24,06:16,Doc,Ole was nowhere near that
2019-10-24,06:17,+263 71 657 5991,Time will tell gentlemen

2019-10-24,06:17,Doc,Lampard's Chelsea is unpredictable too... they have 3 ways they use to play  which makes it hard to effectively manage them tactically during practice

2019-10-24,06:59,+27 81 049 6422,Who would u get ideally and who would bench for that 10
2019-10-24,07:00,Doc,Asensio
2019-10-24,07:01,Doc,He can play as a 10 from the flank and as a 10 from the middle
2019-10-24,07:02,+27 81 049 6422,"Mount is better, and he certainly can't play through the middle, right foot is flat"
2019-10-24,07:02,Doc,"He has an eye for goal, he is fast and he will fit into the young squad"
2019-10-24,07:03,Doc,But we cant rest our everything on the lad... he needs Competition to grow... and in the big games a man like Asensio will pay dividends
2019-10-24,07:03,+27 81 049 6422,Pulisic?
2019-10-24,07:04,Doc,However l hear speculation that over rated James Rodriguez wants to be at Chelsea
2019-10-24,07:04,Doc,Lacks experience
2019-10-24,07:04,Doc,Once Asensio is in we offload Willian
2019-10-24,07:06,+27 81 049 6422,"Pulisic has assisted in almost every game he has played, are you aware of that?  He just needs game time.. Asensio for William would freshen things"
2019-10-24,07:06,Doc,Yes..
2019-10-24,07:06,Doc,We need all of them
2019-10-24,07:07,Doc,Having Asensio will allow Frank to play more shapes ... like the 4 4 2 diamond
2019-10-24,07:07,Doc,With Asensio on the top of the diamond
2019-10-24,07:08,Doc,We can have Pulisic Mount Cheek Odoi Asensio Barkley and we bring back Charlie Musonda
2019-10-24,07:12,+27 81 049 6422,Not bad
2019-10-24,07:13,Doc,Then we have to start making plan to replace Kante

2019-10-26,09:29,+27 83 740 0625,"I am not saying Chele are bad, but they a favorites to finish 3rd if they perform consistently otherwise they might finish 4th"
2019-10-26,09:29,Doc,Beating Soton 9 nil chete... after their best player got a red in 10 mins
2019-10-26,09:29,Doc,We have a team that has 7 people that score goals ...
2019-10-26,09:29,+27 83 740 0625,"That is not my basis, they are second for a reason"
2019-10-26,09:30,+27 81 049 6422,"It's still Lampards first season, he will chuff in December"
2019-10-26,09:30,+27 83 740 0625,He wena !!  Chele is good but there are in a race for 4th and 3rd that my point  Whether your goal keeper can score I don't care
2019-10-26,09:31,+27 81 049 6422,That's on its own makes Chelsea vulnerable
2019-10-26,09:31,+27 83 740 0625,Big point
2019-10-26,09:32,+27 83 740 0625,"They did not have expectations start of season now their expatations is 3rd. Massive mind shift, it will require some metal strength.  They are favorites though but they have to prove that. It not obvious"
2019-10-26,09:32,+27 81 049 6422,Tottenham Arsenal Chelsea Leicester same whatsapp group.
2019-10-26,09:33,+27 81 049 6422,True
2019-10-26,09:33,+27 83 740 0625,Arsenal is close to united that those teams 😂🌚
2019-10-26,09:33,+27 81 049 6422,For different reasons
2019-10-26,09:33,+27 81 049 6422,And if anything Leicester would be the best of those teams
2019-10-26,09:34,+27 83 740 0625,"No comment apa, I see equal potential pa those 3"
2019-10-26,09:34,+27 81 049 6422,"Lol Maya, united, westham, palace, Wolves, another whatsapp group"
2019-10-26,09:35,+27 81 049 6422,Rogers gives them an edge
2019-10-26,09:35,+27 83 740 0625,"Be Arsenal, iwe team iya inotobhowa. Haaaa maybe Lacca adzoka it will be better"
2019-10-26,09:36,+27 83 740 0625,Yes but some can argue that they have the lesser players. Pakaipa
2019-10-26,09:36,+27 81 049 6422,"Scoring goals not an issue, defensively madhadha"
2019-10-26,09:37,+27 81 049 6422,"Vardy, Madison, Chiwell, Ndidi"
2019-10-26,09:38,+27 83 740 0625,Kane Ali lamely dombele Lucas Ericksen
2019-10-26,09:40,+27 83 740 0625,And @263772828867 can tell you about their team with 7 goal scorers. So pakaipa
2019-10-26,09:41,+27 81 049 6422,Lol
2019-10-26,09:45,+27 81 049 6422,"But that's why I said for different reasons these teams are in the same situation, for spurs everyone there is wants out, Arsenal defensively they are weak, and the manager does not make any sensible decisions when picking a starting 11, Chelsea have a new manager and Tammy might be on form but can't really be relied upon in big games especially with this being his first season as the 9 we Chelsea, Leicester for me have a more balance team, who have been together for a bit and Roger's is a top manager and experienced in the league, he is the difference for me pane all these four teams"
2019-10-26,09:47,+27 83 740 0625,I like this analysis 100% agree  However I believe in football heritage more because tiri ma disciples a Mou. Chele has better foooty heritage 😬
2019-10-26,09:49,+27 81 049 6422,"I also believe in football heritage Chelsea and Arsenal, historically know how to finish in the top four"
2019-10-26,10:04,Doc,Zvakurwadza izvi
2019-10-26,10:05,Doc,Asi ichokwadi inozviziva
2019-10-26,10:05,Doc,We are the only team that can replace all attackers in a  game and keep scoring
2019-10-26,10:05,Doc,That has been done more than once
2019-10-26,10:06,Doc,Arsenal haven't done so in some years
2019-10-26,10:07,Doc,They are Europa specialists
2019-10-26,10:08,Doc,Tammy is not Hazard. This team has changed. We get goals even if he doesn't score... we have been winning in the Champions League without his goals
2019-10-26,10:10,Doc,The last time he scored..  he scored once and the team responded by 3 other goals which he wasn't even part of... besides Leicester's last night miracle... only Chelsea and City have so many people on the pitch and from the bench with goal scoring and chance creation abilities
2019-10-26,10:11,+27 81 049 6422,A reputable proven striker and Lampard being new to the league are the only weaknesses I see in your team
2019-10-26,10:11,Doc,But we are beating teams mdara
2019-10-26,10:12,+27 81 049 6422,"Yes you are, but it's not sustainable for a top four race"
2019-10-26,10:12,Doc,Lately we have been keeping consecutive clean sheets
2019-10-26,10:13,+27 81 049 6422,"You still need to score in games, or you won't pick up any points against the top six"
2019-10-26,10:13,Doc,Chelsea and Leicester are the only teams that have been improving form wise... so how is what we are doing not sustainable... we have depth
2019-10-26,10:14,+27 83 740 0625,You guys are improving we agree but your expectations have change in the process. You will see the effect soon
2019-10-26,10:14,Doc,Our first big 6 game was a drubbing 4 nil drubbing the second on we lost in an impressive dog fight
2019-10-26,10:15,Doc,Come Tuesday we have United... check how we are going to destroy them...
2019-10-26,10:15,+27 83 740 0625,Advice  Never use United a bench mark
2019-10-26,10:15,+27 81 049 6422,"I'm not disputing that Doc, I'm highlighting what your shortcomings could be"
2019-10-26,10:15,Doc,It's only Chelsea and City who can line up in 4 different ways at the moment
2019-10-26,10:16,Doc,Are they not part of the big 6 that was being spoken of...  I was only responding to the assertion
2019-10-26,10:17,+27 81 049 6422,"Doc, be fair."
2019-10-26,10:17,+27 81 049 6422,Replace United ne Leicester
2019-10-26,10:18,Doc,Leceister VS Chelsea will be an interesting one... but I know those boys... they will make us proud
2019-10-26,23:45,Doc,We told you... that at Chelsea any gun can shoot...  *Pulisic Hatrick*
2019-10-27,09:45,Doc,Crystal Palace ndinoiziva nekushungurudza imwe team soo

2019-10-27,09:59,+27 81 049 6422,Pulisic must start Doc
2019-10-27,10:15,Doc,Chelsea is not the team to keep a fixed 11 up front. They must rotate so that they keep competing
2019-10-27,10:16,Doc,Kepa Rudiger Jorginho should be the only one to play every game
2019-10-27,10:16,Doc,That's the spine
2019-10-27,10:17,+27 81 049 6422,Kovacic is improving too
2019-10-27,10:17,Doc,Vamwe vese they should fight for it with stella performances

2019-10-27,10:18,Doc,Cant wait for Loftus Cheek to come and teach Mount to be humble
2019-10-27,10:19,Doc,I'm enjoying Tomori above all of them
2019-10-27,10:19,+27 81 049 6422,He is a promising talent
2019-10-27,10:23,Doc,My Captain for that bunch of lads
2019-10-27,10:24,Doc,Captain America should be kept under pressure to develop
2019-10-27,10:24,Doc,He has so much that can come out of him... giving him a first 11 start is a mistake. Anobva azorora
2019-10-27,10:27,+27 81 049 6422,He has reacted very well
2019-10-27,10:43,Doc,Zvese neka Blaz kebhibho kaye kanozviti Odoi kaye... rotation is the solution... kusvika vakutamba bhora chairo

2019-10-27,11:40,+27 81 049 6422,He needs to go to a team where he will start
2019-10-27,11:46,Doc,He has what it takes to compete at Chelsea. But if he takes longer than this season he would have fallen out of favor already
2019-10-27,11:46,Doc,Saka Man U Arsenal etc they will have him
2019-10-27,11:56,+27 81 049 6422,"Considering the ban will be lifted next transfer window, Chelsea will want to buy players, if he hasn't made an impact by then, he will turn into a Drinkwater"
2019-10-27,11:56,+27 81 049 6422,He could be useful at United
2019-10-27,12:00,Doc,We are getting Milinkovic-Savic kuti mumame

2019-06-11,10:51,Doc,Ajax crumbled under the pressure we were putting on them.  The Alonso Recce change was a tactical master class from Frank.  We pressured Ajax regardless of what was on the score board. We pressed them until they unprofessionalism in their big boys came out
2019-06-11,10:52,Doc,Chelsea and United comparable ❌🚮
2019-06-11,10:59,Doc,Kana uchiketa game you could see that Ajax won the first half and thought they had it in the bag.  The heat that they felt in the second half was a total surprise to them..  they couldn't believe why Chelsea was fighting like that when they game seemed decided.  Chelsea's second goal was the game changer. Blind's harsh tackling is one of the many evidencing events that would tell you that these guys were leading but they already had began to succumb to the pressure in the bridge.  And of players that went to harangue the ref for an obvious budge followed by an open boot late tackle all that was evidence Ajax were off mentally and nothing 2as was on their side but only the score line.
2019-06-11,11:06,Rairo,"That was poor refereeing though, Jorginho's second penalty was literally against the rule book. VAR failed Ajax"
2019-06-11,11:07,+263 71 758 4509,Hezvooo munhu akabata woda kuti paitwe sei
2019-06-11,11:09,Rairo,"You were not paying attention or you don't understand the rules, munhu akabata after referee played on. The referee should not have played on if he intended to give Blind a second yellow. Red and second yellow means the game should stop."
2019-06-11,11:15,+27 83 740 0625,Only cheats will say VAR failed.
2019-06-11,11:17,+27 83 740 0625,"I wait  What is you issue, the pen or the red card?"
2019-06-11,11:17,Rairo,The pen shouldn't have happened bscause play should have stopped.
2019-06-11,11:18,+27 83 740 0625,😂  Aww but you agree that it was a penalty right?
2019-06-11,11:18,+263 71 758 4509,Huya nemutemo wacho pano tiuone. Kokana anga akanganwa kuti amupa yellow kare.
2019-06-11,11:19,Rairo,I explained why it wasn't. Let's flip this if Chelsea dai yakarohwa necounter and Blind scored would the referee award the goal and give the Red card?

2019-06-11,11:25,Rairo,That was well after the foul it was not subsequent.

2019-08-11,07:42,+27 81 049 6422,Excuses excuses
2019-08-11,07:42,+27 81 049 6422,Had u rested anyone ud have lost

2019-08-11,07:45,+27 83 740 0625,Even iwe ungati chii   Do you think I like it for United to win under Ole? No because we will win one and loose 4 next games. That one win saves Oles job.  If we were out of Europe playing one game per week Ole would be challanging for 4th. But it's not the case
2019-08-11,07:46,+27 83 740 0625,"It might loose regardless against Mother United  What would you say?  ""We have beaten a small team"" huh?"
2019-08-11,07:47,+27 81 049 6422,"Bro, Brighton is 8th on the log, you will be literally punching above your weight"

2019-08-11,07:49,+27 81 049 6422,And yet you lost 7th and worser opposition
2019-08-11,07:49,+27 83 740 0625,If teams cant beat those under them surely those under them can beat those up the table.   Simple logic  Chelsea fans can understand
2019-08-11,07:49,+27 81 049 6422,Fluke result

2019-08-11,09:13,Doc,*Giggs is the man*
2019-08-11,09:13,Doc,He comes with both leadership and winning pedigree...
2019-08-11,09:14,Doc,He gets Carrick in his Back room staff and create a job for Ferdinand to antagonise Woodward and make proper signings

2019-10-11,19:19,+27 83 740 0625,Thank you Liverpool for exposing a fraud!!
2019-10-11,19:51,Tavonga,U calling the defending champions frauds🤔🤔
2019-10-11,20:01,+27 81 049 6422,Pep
2019-10-11,20:04,Tavonga,Hows he a fraud. He conquered th so called best league in the world. Twice. With record points in both seasons.
2019-10-11,20:14,+27 83 740 0625,Yes
2019-10-11,20:14,+27 83 740 0625,Pep in particular
2019-10-11,20:15,+27 83 740 0625,And hasn't gone past the 1/4 finals of Europe in the process
2019-10-11,20:17,Tavonga,Zidane won 3 in a row. U saying hes better than guardiola?
2019-10-11,20:18,+27 83 740 0625,"Zidane is a SHIT coach  That's what I ""will"" say bearing in mind I hadn't mentioned his name"
2019-10-11,20:19,Tavonga,So it negates yr European competition argument ka.
2019-10-11,20:19,+27 83 740 0625,It was never my argument
2019-10-11,20:19,+27 83 740 0625,"My argument is, pep is a fraud"
2019-10-11,20:19,Tavonga,How so.
2019-10-11,20:19,+27 83 740 0625,You haven't asked why I said so
2019-10-11,20:24,+27 83 740 0625,There we go 😬  He doesn't build on teams to conquer. He assembles teams to conquer. He can do without the money. And USELESS in Europe without Messi. Now it seems Chelsea and Leicester are better.
2019-10-11,20:25,+27 83 740 0625,"But apparently he ""reinvented football""  Changed the EPL  There is nothing like that"
2019-10-11,20:26,Tavonga,Chelsea is suddenly better than Man City. Good thing Chelsea is heading to theEtihad after the international break. If yu really feel chelsea is better then stake some money on the game. Some real money. If u in Harare ee can make the bet between ourslves
2019-10-11,20:26,Rairo,Lol
2019-10-11,20:26,+27 83 740 0625,It's not better than city. But they just have more points as it stands 😂
2019-10-11,20:27,Tavonga,Is there difference how one builds a team. Ultimately the goal is to win. Mourinho pretty much build teams for the present
2019-10-11,20:27,Rairo,@27810496422 controversy hayo but I have to begrudgingly agree Liverpool are the best team in the world at the moment
2019-10-11,20:27,Tavonga,League is 38games
2019-10-11,20:28,Tavonga,City gets tt penalty first minute and the complexion of the game changes. City were robbed
2019-10-11,20:28,+27 83 740 0625,Yes and he will finish below Liverpool I think. Probably ahead of city and out in 1/4 finals or semis of Eufa
2019-10-11,20:28,+27 83 740 0625,It's footbal take it in!!!
2019-10-11,20:28,Rairo,Yes but I don't think any team can withstand a City onslaught like they did today
2019-10-11,20:29,Tavonga,Yep. Doesn't change the fact that City were denied a clear penalty
2019-10-11,20:29,+27 83 740 0625,If it was clear it was gonna be given  Clearly it wasn't
2019-10-11,20:30,+27 83 740 0625,Let me tell you football heritage  Klop vs pep in England  Klop is better
2019-10-11,20:30,Tavonga,So u didn't see the ball hit Trent's arm with sterling waiting to pounce behind him.
2019-10-11,20:30,Rairo,Lol the officiating was terribe you can't deny that even the most staunch Liverpool supporter will agree they got help today
2019-10-11,20:30,+27 83 740 0625,"I saw that, and the ref waving it away and VAR agreed with that."
2019-10-11,20:31,Rairo,Again VAR failed
2019-10-11,20:32,Tavonga,What matters is the overall collective. Pep akaita a domestic treble never before seen in England before. Man u inongodya Chelsea but look at Chelsea pa league table. Bigger picture my frand. Look at the big picture
2019-10-11,20:32,+27 83 740 0625,It was bad but the result was as clear as the clarity of bad officiating.  As fans scorelines  matter than controversies
2019-10-11,20:32,Tavonga,Good point
2019-10-11,20:32,Doc,City cannot not be called to Chelsea
2019-10-11,20:33,+27 83 740 0625,"Ifs it's pep, the domestic treble involving the carabao cup matter ??? Huh  Winning domestic treble is not as challanging."
2019-10-11,20:33,+27 83 740 0625,And it's stood!!
2019-10-11,20:34,Tavonga,How come no team ever won the treble before if its easy. Mourinho anoverenga Community shield pama trophy ake so the carabao is even better
2019-10-11,20:34,+27 83 740 0625,Because no coach takes that carabao cup seriously  Unless a coach who buys two first teams hahaha
2019-10-11,20:35,+27 81 049 6422,YNWA ✌🏿
2019-10-11,20:35,+27 83 740 0625,Mou won in Europe that's what I know

2019-10-11,20:38,+27 83 740 0625,United treble better than city's treble  That's not trolling  Those a facts
2019-10-11,20:38,+27 83 740 0625,Pep apera!!!
2019-10-11,20:39,Tavonga,I support Man U but give credit where its due. The dude conquered yamunoty the best league. Hws that fraudulent?
2019-10-11,20:39,+27 83 740 0625,He can only win the domestic double and we we hail him again  For fucks sake!!!
2019-10-11,20:39,Rairo,"You said it was easy but it had never been done before just like the 100 points, Guardiola is the best manager in the world, every other manager will tell you that including the unemployed Mourinho"
2019-10-11,20:39,+27 83 740 0625,Who did not conquer it?  RANIERRI did  So sit down United and City fan🌚
2019-10-11,20:40,Tavonga,I remember last season Liverpool having a 7 point lead in January. Three months later we all kno who took the trophy hom
2019-10-11,20:40,+27 83 740 0625,And city having lost 1
2019-10-11,20:40,Rairo,"True Bobby, City, Everton and us will stop them in crunch time again"
2019-10-11,20:41,Tavonga,No Pep bent the league to his will. Amassing over 100 points. A feat never achieved before in the English league. And defended the league the following season. Manchester united l think were the last team to successfully defend the league. And wen was that. I remember ranieri getting sacked a few games in the following season
2019-10-11,20:42,Tavonga,Man U pa liver totomira mira and Everton inenge ichitorambira pa derby
2019-10-11,20:45,Rairo,"Lol yeah And it's in the best interests for all 3 that they don't win their first PL, Sky Sports will be unbearable if that were to happen"
2019-11-11,13:19,+27 83 740 0625,"I present to you my reasons why I say Pep is a FRAUD. Its a class in session, I will only comment sensible points. Firstly, Guardiola is an inheritance merchant.  Let’s take a look at the players he inherited at each club. Barca: Messi, Eto’o, Henry, Puyol, Iniesta, Xavi, Toure, Valdes Bayern (treble winners): Robben, Ribery, Muller, Kroos, Schweinsteiger, Lahm, Neuer, Boateng, Mandzukic  Man City (CL semi finalists): Silva, Aguero, Sterling, Be Bruyne, Kompany, Fernandinho And yet he STILL manages to spend well over a BILLION between these clubs Only Mourinho and Ancelotti have spent more money on transfers in their careers than Guardiola. However JM and CA both been in management twice as long as Guardiola, and bought over 100 players each, whereas Guardiola has spent over €1.1 billion on 52 players, averaging at over €22M per player (compared to Mourinho €15.5M per player and Ancelotti €14M per player)   Conte and Guardiola arrived in the PL at the same time. One inherited a 10th placed team and the other had just reached the CL semis. One spent £90M and the other £213M. Who implemented them style quicker and won the league in record breaking fashion first?  While Conte’s tactics were revolutionizing the Premier League, Guardiola went trophy-less, losing 4-0 to Everton and getting knocked out the cup by Wigan. He had to spend £477M before getting his hands on a trophy in England."
2019-11-11,13:20,+27 83 740 0625,...it continues
2019-11-11,13:32,+27 83 740 0625,"The only teams he's actually beaten in CL knockout with Man City are Basel and Schalke. Also became the first manager to get knocked out while his team scored 6 (vs Monaco) UEFA given him as much help as possible too with the easiest possible draws every time. At the end of the day, Guardiola was brought to Man City to win the CL, but instead he’s failed to get further than his predecessor, despite assembling the most expensive squad in the HISTORY of football. And he's already 9 points from the top after 12 matches, in 4th place.   Bayern Munich got to 3 Champions League finals and won the CL as part of a treble before Guardiola arrived... In his 3 years he failed to take them beyond the semi finals and conceded 5 over two legs vs both Madrid and Barcelona, and also got knocked out by underdogs Atletico.  Mandzukic said he felt like Guardiola disrespected him when he was sold and changed Bayern for the worse, also got rid of Kroos, an even worse decision I'm sure Mandzukic and Kroos don't mind tho considering they've both been in CL finals since unlike a certain fraud.  Guardiola got bullied into a sabbatical by Mourinho's (ofcoz I would mention the boss😎) Madrid when they steamrolled La Liga, accumulating over 100 points He also failed to win a CL away tie at Barcelona for 2 years. Luis Enrique went on to achieve the same as Guardiola, even with an inferior squad.  Guardiola was certainly a beneficiary of Uefalona, as we all remember the scandalous semi final against Chelsea and the Robin Van Perse red card If not for blatant cheating such as this, Guardiola would have zero European titles. All Arsenal fans can testify to this!!  Listen, for a manager who spends so much money, Guardiola’s track record of signings is surprisingly poor. At Man City alone, he's signed expensive flops such as Danilo, Bravo, Nolito, Mendy, Jesus to name a few. Of course, no one realizes this because he is always bailed out by the players he inherited. Also why he only goes to clubs with unlimited funds so he can quickly replace his own flops until they work out.  Guardiola can't handle personalities. First thing he does at his new clubs is force out the biggest characters in the dressing room, for fear of them speaking up and exposing him in front of everyone. See Toure, Mandzukic, Hart, Ibrahimovic, etc. In fact I would suggest Guardiola is a poor man manager full stop. Why is Thiago the only player to have ever followed Guardiola to a new club?  His players may not have followed Guardiola to new clubs but his dodgy doctors have. His Barcelona team were known for their high energy pressing game when they lost possession and they were at their peak at the time Dr. Fuentes was operating. His Nandralone history is all over the web and the rumours are that his players were on EPO and blood transfusions in Barcelona - operation Puerto. (Link: https://t.co/fTTmEALSmc)  In summary, there is corruption and racism following Guardiola at every club he goes to. Couple that with the world class squads he’s inherited and the unlimited spending he’s done at each club, his achievements turn out to be the bare minimum.  Guardiola only succeeds in circumstances where it’s impossible to fail!!!"
2019-11-11,13:36,+27 83 740 0625,Class has ended!!! Kana magetsi aenda you can educate yourselves and stop this myopic behavior of analysis which has since creeped into the world of football.

2019-11-11,15:55,+263 77 541 9969,"LIVERPOOL V MANCHESTER CITY VAR made correct Alexander-Arnold decision but the Premier League is wrong - Clattenburg Peter Lynch Last updated 9 hours ago  getty images The former referee believes VAR took into account a previous handball by Bernardo Silva  Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg has agreed with the VAR call that allowed Liverpool’s opening goal against Manchester City to stand, but says the Premier League explanation was incorrect.  The Reds took the lead through Fabinho’s sixth-minute strike, but VAR was forced to look into a potential handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold in the build up.  Despite the ball striking the Liverpool defender’s arm, the goal stood, much to the anger of the City players and coaching staff. And Clattenburg has agreed with the decision, but believes the reasoning behind it by the Premier League was flawed.  The former official argued that a handball from City’s Bernardo Silva was the correct reason why the goal stood, as opposed to the Premier League explanation that Alexander-Arnold’s was not a deliberate handball.  “VAR and Michael Oliver made the correct call in allowing Fabinho's early goal to stand, although I disagree with the reasoning the Premier League have provided,” Clattenburg told the MailOnline.  “There were strong suggestions at the time that the effort should be disallowed and a penalty awarded to Manchester City because Trent Alexander-Arnold had handled at the other end moments before the goal.  “However, it is the arm of Manchester City forward Bernardo Silva that deflects the ball onto Alexander-Arnold and that is why, for me, play should not be brought back.  “If Silva's arm does not divert the ball, then yes, I believe a penalty should have been awarded as Alexander-Arnold's arm is in an unnatural position and he is using it to make himself bigger.  “That is why I do not understand the Premier League explanation that it was not a deliberate handball.”  Handball? Don't ask me, ask the referees! - Guardiola City boss Pep Guardiola was seen firmly shaking referee Michael Oliver’s hand and repeating the words, ""thank you so much"", in a sarcastic tone after the match, but refused to be drawn into any debate surrounding VAR.  The defeat leaves City in fourth place going into another international break, nine points behind league leaders Liverpool.  The loss at Anfield also condemned Guardiola to his worst start to a season in his entire managerial career, with City’s total of 25 points the fewest the Spaniard has won after 12 games into a campaign"
2019-11-11,16:19,+27 83 740 0625,"But it stood. This argument might be right but that's football. No one will remember this,  When Liverpool was thrashed 5-0 by city a few remember there were 10 men.  That's how it works"

2019-11-24,20:10,+27 81 049 6422,"I feel you Bro, I hope you get Allegri, at least"
2019-11-24,20:10,+27 84 378 3617,Nonsense

2019-05-12,01:27,Doc,I now respect Ole...  He doesn't lose big games. Zvapera
2019-05-12,05:27,+263 71 657 5991,I seem to get a sense that the preparation and how he motivates players differ depending with the opponent which is quite sad. He should really work on that cz league is a marathon
2019-05-12,05:56,Doc,Yes
2019-05-12,05:57,Doc,When the whistle was blown to start the game seeing how those boys in red were running l told myself that Tototo l losing this game these boys mean business
2019-05-12,05:58,Doc,So lts kinda mind boggling how he then looses to every small team
2019-05-12,08:13,Rairo,LvG was the same way lol
2019-05-12,08:14,+27 81 049 6422,Wave ne data?

2019-05-12,08:28,Doc,Ole ihwai zvake
2019-05-12,08:28,Doc,LVG is great
2019-05-12,08:29,+27 84 378 3617,I agree but the trend of results at united a Ole is similar to LVG
2019-05-12,08:30,+27 81 049 6422,@263772828867 this game had nothing to do with Ole though
2019-05-12,08:30,+27 81 049 6422,The players themselves turned up for that game
2019-05-12,08:31,+27 81 049 6422,"Even the crowd was at it, they wouldn't have wanted to lose to Mou"
2019-05-12,08:38,Doc,But Ole has done well against the big teams
2019-05-12,08:39,Doc,He is the only coach to at least salvage a drawn against Kloop's rollercoaster
2019-05-12,08:39,Doc,Beat Chelsea always
2019-05-12,08:45,+27 81 049 6422,Ole akaramba akadai he is on the wheel futi next season 💯
2019-05-12,08:46,Doc,And United will not even make Europa naye
2019-05-12,08:47,Doc,Asi weekend anowundura hake... Pep haana ma funny
2019-05-12,08:48,+27 81 049 6422,You'd think so but City will win with one goal margin
2019-05-12,08:48,+27 81 049 6422,Somehow the players at United believe in Ole. He is giving youth the chance to play
2019-05-12,09:00,Doc,That youth haina a United level of talent
2019-05-12,09:01,+27 84 378 3617,He was hired based on PSG game only for sure he will be here next year this time based on the Tottenham performance. Thats how we do it at Manchester
2019-05-12,09:01,Doc,With their belief last night is the best they can do
2019-05-12,09:01,+27 84 378 3617,But he will stay
2019-05-12,09:01,Doc,Ehe
2019-05-12,09:02,+27 81 049 6422,"Definitely, but he has got those young boys on his side and especially because its him giving them a chance at such a big club like united"
2019-05-12,09:03,+27 81 049 6422,It will be a very inconsistent United under Ole. Youth is moody.
2019-05-12,09:03,+27 84 378 3617,Supporting United with emotions under Ole is an irresposible act
2019-05-12,09:05,Doc,Yah
2019-05-12,09:05,Doc,I think the only youth policies that are currently making sense in Eutop are Ajax and Chelsea
2019-05-12,09:06,+27 81 049 6422,True
2019-05-12,09:07,+27 81 049 6422,"Without being too harsh on United, the youth players are actually being let down by generally poor older players, Jones, Young, Fred etc, players who aren't United players anymore"
2019-05-12,09:13,Doc,That's true
2019-05-12,18:26,,"Doc: Breaking News 🚨🚨🚨: The Court of Arbitration for Sport has made the decision to reduce Chelsea Football Clubs transfer ban, which was imposed on them early this year. This means that Chelsea will be able to purchase players during the January 2020 transfer window."
2019-05-12,18:48,Doc,Time to deal with some dead rubber

2019-05-12,18:58,Doc,They will always be expectations and we are not scared of that because all we need is to maintain the talent we have and in 2 seasons time we will have one of the squads in Europe
2019-05-12,19:02,Doc,We are offloading bigtime
2019-05-12,19:02,Doc,Something we couldn't do when we were not allowed to buy

2019-06-12,03:44,Doc,He is left with one chance paanodzoka apa if he blows that then its Loftus Cheek's turn and the lack of playing minutes that will chase him away. And while he was injured we fixed our starting 11
2019-06-12,03:45,+27 84 378 3617,The guy had no chance anymore.

2019-06-12,13:54,Rairo,Lol Wilshere peaked at 19 and has been trash ever since.
2019-06-12,13:54,Doc,Who is Wilshere
2019-06-12,13:55,Rairo,"I agree with you for once you're paying attention lol, Chelsea has only passed on test and that's Ajax away, they have failed every time they've met a decent team."
2019-06-12,13:58,Rairo,Phil Foden and Wan Bissaka
2019-06-12,14:12,Doc,Confirm small games earn you the same points with big games?  Confirm also that it's the total tally that gets you into the top 4 not big teams points.  So if we are winning small games doesn't it mean we will have more points than the teams you are fancing Who are winning big games only and loose to the weaker sides who apparently are more in number than the stronger sides.
2019-06-12,14:16,Rairo,Lol you just got beat by West Ham at home paweekend. A decent team means one that's well drilled on the day. You crumble when challenged that's my point. Christmas will be tough on you.
2019-06-12,14:24,Doc,We have lost to only Westham
2019-06-12,14:24,Doc,Pama small teams
2019-06-12,14:24,Doc,But United and Tottenham are the daily bread for small teams
2019-06-12,14:25,Doc,And on the day were missing our goal scoring machine and probably our best player

2019-12-26,09:12,Doc,Man... I like one thing about you. You're objective. I'm a Chelsea fan but l should be able to admit stuff that's not going well for my team.
2019-12-26,09:13,Doc,But this mentality of being fanatics is what has kept Zimbabwe head down
2019-12-26,09:14,Rairo,"Doc you are not objective, we told you about Chelsea's weakeness in big games and you were blind to it lol"

2019-12-26,15:31,+27 84 378 3617,I like how other coaches are supposed to be judged after 4 transfer windows and others after 9 games
2019-12-26,15:31,+27 84 378 3617,Fucking myopia
2019-12-26,15:32,Doc,Unless this Tottenham harm team changes strategy  (remuneration in particular) Mourinho is a buying coach... he will struggle in the long run
2019-12-26,15:33,+27 84 378 3617,I think he deserves to assemble his club and be judged accordingly  For now I can see the reason why Poch was fired
2019-12-26,15:37,Rairo,"He's not getting any ""transfers"" with Levy he took this out of desperation he's done out here"
2019-12-26,15:38,+27 84 378 3617,Then Levy should be blamed for the bad results
2019-12-26,15:39,Rairo,You need to spend to dominate an injury ravaged Brighton?😂😂😂
2019-12-26,15:39,+27 84 378 3617,I am saying a coach needs to assemble a team he can work with

2020-02-01,15:02,Doc,Greenwood vs Beckham Lindelhof vs Vidic Fred vs Scholes Matic vs Veron  Pogba is not your player... he has reserved his best for the club he wants to play for...
2020-02-01,15:02,+27 84 378 3617,"United needs to buy a few players, it's a fact  Sadly that's wont make Ole coach better so the players will still not win"

2020-02-01,15:04,Doc,De Gear used to be good... but the fact that Goalkeepers are now play makers from the back and he cant play with his feet he is now obsolete ... the game has evolved

2020-02-01,15:05,+27 84 378 3617,I dont believe it that philosophy as a fact of football. It's your opinion. Goal keepers should save balls from getting in the net. Finish

2020-02-01,15:06,Doc,He is the world's best Goal keeper on his feet

2020-02-01,15:10,Doc,"He is not waiting to dive... which he also does, but not as good as De Gear... but he starts the passing game from the back"
2020-02-01,15:10,Doc,Some DDG cant do
2020-02-01,15:11,Doc,Ederson is almost useless when it comes to saves... but anopasa bhora tsano
2020-02-01,15:11,+27 84 378 3617,"So if he can do something DDG is not good at, he becomes better?"
2020-02-01,15:11,+27 84 378 3617,I dont rate Ederson because haabate
2020-02-01,15:11,Doc,He is moving with the trend of the game

2020-11-03,12:26,Rairo,Arsenal is also trash this season

2020-11-03,12:27,+27 81 049 6422,As a point against your statement to say they made top four
2020-11-03,12:27,Rairo,"They were in the CL final last year and qualified for the CL this year, they are by definition under performing"
2020-11-03,12:28,+27 84 378 3617,Sense injection 🙏🏼

2020-11-03,12:30,Rairo,They are out of the top 4 places
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 84 378 3617,If you have 5 important players injured you can't do much
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 81 049 6422,"Liverpool lost 3 games in a trot too, means nothing"
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 81 049 6422,Compare their numbers to last season
2020-11-03,12:30,Rairo,Norwich came to Tottenham and won there and they're 20th placed
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 81 049 6422,And they have injuries
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 84 378 3617,And it's in their hands to be in top four still
2020-11-03,12:30,+27 81 049 6422,Not yet.
2020-11-03,12:31,Rairo,It's only a matter of time now
2020-11-03,12:31,+27 84 378 3617,"Watford beat liverpool,"
2020-11-03,12:31,Rairo,Liverpool will win the league

2020-11-03,12:32,+27 84 378 3617,That's how analysis is done simple
2020-11-03,12:32,+27 81 049 6422,Mourinho apera but that Spurs squad is washed up too
2020-11-03,12:33,Rairo,Man United have topped the injury table most of the season and I wouldn't give that as an excuse to solskjaer
2020-11-03,12:33,+27 84 378 3617,"I respect first point, and I agree fully with he last one"
2020-11-03,12:33,Rairo,Not to be out played game in game out though
2020-11-03,12:34,+27 81 049 6422,If you meet better opposition that's what happens
2020-11-03,12:34,+27 81 049 6422,But they still have the same performance as last season
2020-11-03,12:35,+27 84 378 3617,"That's why they are not different from Spurs in terms of points , and mind you United had a manager for longer and Spurs injuries started coming after they were already 14th,  Do the analysis,  who is doing better against all odds"
2020-11-03,12:35,+27 84 378 3617,"So when he beats City it's not impo6, but when Ole beats city it's a masterclass"
2020-11-03,12:36,+27 81 049 6422,"Ita analysis Gida, Spurs been free falling since Poch, akasiya chaora"
2020-11-03,12:36,Rairo,Injuries are not an excuse in my book that's my point that's why we a reserve team and a youth team

2020-11-03,12:38,+27 84 378 3617,"Unfair point, injuries do affect quality of football display"
2020-11-03,12:39,+27 84 378 3617,Maybe that doesn't matter to him too
2020-11-03,12:40,Rairo,"Football quality has nothing to do with personnel, that's why Nagelsmann is successful"
2020-11-03,12:43,+27 84 378 3617,"No comment,"

2020-11-03,13:05,+27 84 378 3617,There is hope for you if you can still reason like this

2020-11-03,13:08,+27 84 378 3617,"He should win trophies,  I think he is in the right direction.  But for someone who started coaching at 28, breaking records like ""youngest manager to ,,,,,"" its useless"
2020-11-03,13:10,Rairo,"It's not because how many people started coaching at 28? That shows how good he is, he took Relegation candidates hoffenheim into the champions league."
2020-11-03,13:11,+27 84 378 3617,"Claudio took relegation candidates to winning epl, I still dont think he is an Amazing coach, he is average  I speak of age because that's the record you referenced, ""youngest manager......"""
2020-11-03,13:13,Rairo,"Well that one season he was excellent though, Nagelsmann is improving every year"
2020-11-03,13:15,Rairo,It's his record and it will be perched in the history books for a while
2020-11-03,13:17,+27 84 378 3617,That record has much to do with the time he started managing.
2020-11-03,13:18,Rairo,Because he's good
2020-11-03,13:19,Rairo,You act like you just wake up and get handed a managerial post
2020-11-03,13:21,+27 84 378 3617,"I acknowledge he is in the right direction but this youngest manager to win what what is useless   What will we say for Sarri, who started late? If he is just as good as the kid who did his coaching badges at a young age"
2020-11-03,13:22,Rairo,It's much harder to start early evidently
2020-11-03,13:22,Rairo,Sarri is not unique

2020-11-03,13:32,+27 84 378 3617,"No, not incredibly hard, it highlights a change in trend, we will be getting more young coaches"
2020-11-03,13:33,Rairo,Over the last 3 years How many managers under 30 are managing in Europe's top 5 leagues if it's a trend?
2020-11-03,13:37,+27 84 378 3617,"We are going to be getting more of these. It is not a hard thing, is a decision which needs to made"
2020-11-03,13:38,Rairo,Lol I hope you're joking

2020-11-03,19:14,Rairo,"Liverpool haifaniri kuita dzungu or it will concede first, Simeone like Klopp is fantastic in 2 legged European ties. Liverpool should first feel the tempo of the game and approach with caution."
2020-11-03,19:17,+27 81 049 6422,"True, and we have been very poor, intensity is low, Anfield will lift us for probably the first 20 minutes, after that it's Atleticos match to lose"

2020-10-06,09:41,Doc,@capsunitedfczw is burning again. Players want their $$$. An embarrassing audio of @capsunitedfczw VP Nhamo Tutisani exchanging words with players has started circulating. Tutisani can be heard telling the players to sleep at the offices if they got evicted at their places of residence Tutisani threatens to offload players and the boys say no ways. If you fire one you fire all. Then the CAPS VP tells one player that he will not allow him to play for Makepekepe. Tutisani can be heard cursing who the f@@k do you think you are!

2020-06-19,08:40,Doc,At Chelsea...  The Kante story is puzzling hey
2020-06-19,08:41,+263 77 621 1237,Keita is never fit. It's good business to cash in on him
2020-06-19,08:42,+27 81 049 6422,What's the story
2020-06-19,08:46,Doc,<Media omitted>
2020-06-19,09:00,+27 81 049 6422,"If Lampard wants to launch a strong title challenge next season, Kante to keep, those are type of guys who will go an extra yard, and over board to win you games, in terms of how his role changed, it just goes to show how much of a good player he is and how versatile he can be, which is a plus. For footballing reasons, Lampard should build a midfield around him for season, considering he is fit. Now for financial reasons and good business, approaching 30, if not 30 already, and being injury prone in the last few seasons, you sell him to PSG, get between 30 to 50 million and build."
2020-06-19,09:04,Doc,Madrid are willing to pay 70 mil
2020-06-19,09:05,Doc,He is indeed a match winner... but economics and fitness are against him now

2020-06-19,15:45,Rairo,Also Put Werner pagun and bring in Pulisic
2020-06-19,15:46,Doc,Zouma is a bit clumsy sometimes...  I would put Rudiger there
2020-06-19,15:47,Doc,Mount is Frank's favourite but the coming of Haverts may give more competition that's needed for that place
2020-06-19,15:48,Rairo,If you say so but it's not much of an upgrade
2020-06-19,15:49,+27 81 049 6422,Hakuna defender kuChelsea
2020-06-19,15:49,Rairo,"He thinks he can turn Mount into a Frank 2.0 😂, isu tina bruno na Pogba, City in KDB naBernado munofa 😂"
2020-06-19,15:49,+27 81 049 6422,Trial and error chete
2020-06-19,15:49,Rairo,True
2020-06-19,15:50,Doc,That's true... we cant match that with Mount
2020-06-19,15:50,Doc,"Kante is in that class hake, but lately he is always injured"
2020-06-19,15:51,Rairo,That's your only proper midfielder isando chairo but ari1 manje
2020-06-19,15:51,Doc,"Objectively... Rudiger na James are good players,"
2020-06-19,15:52,+27 84 378 3617,I think Tammy is more suited for the CF role because of the way he plays.  He is stronger and can play with back to goal. I don't see Pulisic adding any more value with his inclusion
2020-06-19,15:52,Rairo,Next season hausikuitya ndazviona
2020-06-19,15:53,Rairo,"Werner does all of that better than Tammy, Pulisic is better wide."
2020-06-19,15:54,Doc,Pulisic may fall down the pecking order and become a squad player...
2020-06-19,15:54,Doc,I think the same too
2020-06-19,15:54,+27 84 378 3617,He can play with back to goal. He has rarely been utilised like that.  He will attack more from the left
2020-06-19,15:55,Doc,Werner is smaller than Tammy... Tammy is a better target man
2020-06-19,15:55,Doc,Tammy can create space for Werner ... to play more goal facing balls
2020-06-19,15:57,Rairo,"Height? 😂 are going to be playing hoofball?  Werner has already played under 3 systems under Rangnick, Loew and Nagelsmann at a higher level than Tammy."
2020-06-19,15:58,Rairo,Might as well bring Fellaini from China
2020-06-19,15:58,Doc,"I agree, Werner has seen more than Tammy"
2020-06-19,15:58,Doc,That's why he is not even afraid to come and challenge Tammy
2020-06-19,16:00,+27 81 049 6422,Ari ku joker
2020-06-19,16:00,Rairo,"Tammy can play FA cup games or if Lampard decides to go with 2 strikers, maybe this 4-3-3 with them can work I don't know Emerson anofanira kusimba though if that's the case"
2020-06-19,16:00,Doc,But in a 3 striker situation or 2 striker situation I fancy Tammy for CF and Werner on the left... if when Frank want to make a tactical change he can pull off Tammy and move Werner to the centre
2020-06-19,16:01,+27 81 049 6422,"Good EPL players, not at the standard required to challenge for the league"
2020-06-19,16:01,Doc,I stand with those 2...  Chelsea's best bet is David Alaba (Among all the available defenders)
2020-06-19,16:01,Rairo,With full backs like Liverpool's or Mendy he can set up like that easily but how good are your full backd going forward.
2020-06-19,16:02,Doc,Defense does not deem to have all good players...  Inongoda leader chete
2020-06-19,16:02,Rairo,Those leaders are rare
2020-06-19,16:02,Rairo,And expensive
2020-06-19,16:02,Doc,Matip/Gomes are not the best defenders but they have a leader in VVD
2020-06-19,16:03,Doc,I agree
2020-06-19,16:03,Rairo,"They are not as good as VVD but they pass some standard, Gomes this season is exceptional"
2020-06-19,16:04,Doc,"Munhu chaiye wekuti dai zvese zvaibvuma anogona kupedza dambudziko re Chelsea *De Ligt* he is a leader, he is fearless and he is young while experienced...  But he is not available"

2020-06-19,16:41,+27 81 049 6422,Fred is not a soccer player
2020-06-19,16:55,Doc,🤣🤣🤣🤣
2020-06-19,17:00,+27 84 378 3617,"Kugwara uku  The skill ya Fred which is most utilised at United is is work rate. That's why he is deployed deeper and has had comparable figures, even better in some cases, with the best players who play there e.g. Kante  Trying to compare Loftus and Fred and going on to say ""haasi munhu webhora"" is blind hate.  It's a result of  misguided support for a player who plays on the stretcher more often than not."

2020-06-20,10:20,Doc,Ole is a typical Crystal Palace manager. United haaikwanise
2020-06-20,10:24,Rairo,"Ole only lost to Klopp in the top 6, beat Pep and Lampard 6 times in one season in one season (without Paul Pogba for 5 of those games)"
2020-06-20,10:24,Rairo,Stop
2020-06-20,10:28,+263 78 524 8595,<Media omitted>
2020-06-20,10:28,+263 78 524 8595,With the youngest team too #facts
2020-06-20,10:31,+263 71 657 5991,Thank you. I dont even know where this fixation with Ole comes from. The guy beats their teams home and away and they still have the nerve to call him inept. Luck didnt get him where he is on the table. He is doing something right and give him credit Please
2020-06-20,10:32,Doc,Ole wins Big games hapana ane nharo ipapo
2020-06-20,10:32,Doc,Vese ana PSG akarova avo
2020-06-20,10:33,Doc,But what decides success is winning also against small teams. Because beating a big team gives equal points to beating a small team
2020-06-20,10:33,Doc,When he beat Chelsea 4 nil he sis not get 5 points
2020-06-20,10:35,Doc,He has the best record against big teams but he is still running the risk of playing Europa due to the defeats from small teams. *Old Trafford* yandinoziva inini ma small team players vaiita sevachachema knowing that they have a game in that stadium
2020-06-20,10:35,Rairo,"He's not English, Lampard escapes criticism because of that."
2020-06-20,10:36,Doc,But Ole loses in OT as if he is playing in Spain
2020-06-20,10:36,Rairo,Time ichiripo 9 gales left Sheffield might get the 4th spot who knows lol
2020-06-20,10:37,Doc,I'm not saying Ole will miss out but I'm showing you that he has not many big games left... and pama small teams ndipo paanobayiwa zvake
2020-06-20,10:38,Doc,"Dont defend the man, United needs a manager who has capacity for the world's biggest team"
2020-06-20,10:38,Doc,Do you see yourself winning anything with Ole?
2020-06-20,10:39,Doc,"Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal are all easier clubs compared to United"
2020-06-20,10:39,Rairo,"We yes but at the moment ndiye aripo, sure thing managers are rare these days"
2020-06-20,10:39,Doc,United haisi team inogonekwa nana Baba Shupi
2020-06-20,10:39,Rairo,FA cup is coming home

2020-06-20,10:41,Doc,Hatina kuvaitira nyasha
2020-06-20,10:41,+263 78 524 8595,"Its ironic when statements like these come from Chelsea fans yet Lampard has lost more games than ole and the only reason they are above is because of the draws Man utd have,? the most amongst the top 6. Well 🤷🏼‍♂"
2020-06-20,10:42,Doc,Ole spent over 100 million usakanganwe
2020-06-20,10:43,Doc,Lampard took boys from the Championship and he made it work
2020-06-20,10:43,Rairo,Chelsea finished 3rd last season
2020-06-20,10:44,Doc,"Lampard was not in charge then, ... Mamutse taught you to compare like with like in his Maths class mfanha"
2020-06-20,10:44,Rairo,So Chelsea actually regressed with him in charge that's my point
2020-06-20,10:45,Doc,Chelsea scored 63 goals in that season  and the player who contributed these goals was sold before Lampard came in
2020-06-20,10:45,Rairo,He was given Pulisic in advance
2020-06-20,10:45,Rairo,He failed to integrate him
2020-06-20,10:45,Doc,They lost the player who was involved in 32 of the 63 goals
2020-06-20,10:46,+27 81 049 6422,Roy is better than Ole
2020-06-20,10:46,Doc,Ole had all his squad plus the world's most expensive defender
2020-06-20,10:46,Rairo,Lol
2020-06-20,10:47,Rairo,A squad that finished 6th after some good work from him
2020-06-20,10:47,+27 81 049 6422,"Beating big teams is all he has, Ole is Uniteds weakness"
2020-06-20,10:47,Doc,"Lampard had nothing, no experience, no signings and had lost the club's top scorer"
2020-06-20,10:47,Rairo,Lol he had a team that finished 3rd
2020-06-20,10:47,Doc,Kkkkkkkkk Ole 🤣🤣🤣 haaaaaa
2020-06-20,10:47,+27 81 049 6422,Ole will miss out!!!
2020-06-20,10:47,Rairo,We'll see
2020-06-20,10:48,+27 81 049 6422,He doesn't have enough top six teams to beat 😂😂😂😂
2020-06-20,10:48,Doc,Check the ream that finished 3rd and the team that's playing for Lampard... those are different squads
2020-06-20,10:48,Rairo,Only Hazard chete
2020-06-20,10:48,Doc,Rodgers may surprisingly miss out🤣
2020-06-20,10:49,Rairo,He's too far gone but Ole will clip some of his wings in the remaining leg
2020-06-20,10:49,Doc,"Leceister yanga yakubika beans muna Feb umo, their luck was finished"
2020-06-20,10:50,Doc,I fancy Ole over Rodgers
2020-06-20,10:50,+27 81 049 6422,"Nah, they gone bro"
2020-06-20,10:50,Rairo,This is like a reset
2020-06-20,10:50,+27 81 049 6422,Whose wings if not Chelsea my guy
2020-06-20,10:51,Rairo,I'm saying we are getting 3pts from Leicester again
2020-06-20,10:51,+27 81 049 6422,"Ya, mogona kuibata"
2020-06-20,10:55,Doc,The fact that Leicester are playing United its advantage Chelsea
2020-06-20,10:55,Doc,What ever result from that game were are benefiting
2020-06-20,10:55,Rairo,Only if you win your games
2020-06-20,10:56,Doc,It looks like all teams will be winning but Chelsea will be losing
2020-06-20,10:56,Doc,Even in a Game week where you have drawn with a team we beat and we are playing Aston Villa
2020-06-20,10:56,Rairo,Remember December/January 🤣
2020-06-20,10:56,Rairo,You were so far ahead before Christmas
2020-06-20,10:56,Doc,You still cant smell that you will be 5 points behind by tomorrow
2020-06-20,10:57,Rairo,Grealish masterclass coming
2020-06-20,10:57,Doc,So all moths are remembered except February
2020-06-20,10:57,Rairo,I'm saying it's happened before
2020-06-20,10:57,Rairo,Nakamba clinic
2020-06-20,10:58,Doc,Reece James
2020-06-20,10:58,Doc,Ask Zaha
2020-06-20,10:58,Doc,He was out classed by James
2020-06-20,10:58,Rairo,Tomorrow not too far
2020-06-20,10:59,Doc,If Lampard manages a draw against City then Ole and Rodgers will have to decide who comes 4th
2020-06-20,11:02,+263 78 524 8595,"Though Ole may not be the right person for the job coz they are obviously better managers out there, one cannot ignore progress he has done , for stability he should stay for another 2 seasons"
2020-06-20,11:02,Doc,Leceister is 5 points ahead of us and they have United to play
2020-06-20,11:03,Doc,He deserves next season and more money to get better attack minded players
2020-06-20,11:03,Doc,I agree
2020-06-20,11:03,+27 81 049 6422,"It's not a clear cut game, anything can happen there"
2020-06-20,11:04,Doc,"Whatever happens, its advantage Chelsea"
2020-06-20,11:04,+27 81 049 6422,Top four will be decided on a weekly basis.
2020-06-20,11:05,Doc,United lose we gain on United  Leicester lose we gain on them  Draw we gain on both teams
2020-06-20,11:05,Doc,I agree
2020-06-20,11:05,+27 81 049 6422,"Wolves is contention and you never know how Sheffield are going to handle this, it's very interesting top four race"
2020-06-20,11:05,+263 78 524 8595,But Chelsea iri pama1 hayo they still have to play city and liver
2020-06-20,11:05,Doc,Leceister Chelsea United  We probably will all have shock results here and there
2020-06-20,11:05,+263 78 524 8595,Top 4 is ours to lose
2020-06-20,11:06,Doc,That's true... those games ma1

2020-06-20,15:56,Doc,The centrehalfs are the Weakness...  They will be split by the first diagonal ball between them. Maupay will score... Brighton just needs a smart midfielder who can put that ball in when at that moment to split Holding and Mustafi
2020-06-20,16:03,Doc,Otherwise l give the game to Arsenal 4 1

2020-06-21,19:21,+27 81 049 6422,"Ya, CB is the most pressing issue for you guys"
2020-06-21,19:22,Doc,Alaba and Ake are all left footed and can play both CB and Left Back
2020-06-21,19:22,Doc,And they will all cost less then £85 million
2020-06-21,19:23,+27 81 049 6422,"Ake is good, but you still need a leader at the back"
2020-06-21,19:23,+27 81 049 6422,Koulibaly over both Alaba and Ake would be a great addition
2020-06-21,19:25,+27 84 378 3617,The coach has a plan
2020-06-21,19:25,Doc,We dont afford Koulibaly

2020-06-07,15:49,+27 84 378 3617,I agree
2020-06-07,15:49,Ticha Flombo,Matic is actually the reason why united picked form..it gives ana pogba freedom

2020-06-07,15:51,Doc,I prefer Fred to Matic though
2020-06-07,15:52,+27 81 049 6422,Fred was doing well before the lockdown when united started to get better
2020-06-07,15:54,Doc,Mctominay is a typical Everton player.. he is not big team standard
2020-06-07,15:54,+27 84 378 3617,before bruno and after McSauce and rashy got injured we started this unbeaten run we pride ourselves on
2020-06-07,15:54,+263 78 524 8595,"Fred doesn't have composure on the ball like matic, neither does he have the ability to control the game like Matic, same same na mctonamay wake, Which is why ka mfana ka Garner kaya will walk straight into the starting 11 when his time comes"
2020-06-07,15:55,Doc,Garner  ndiani?
2020-06-07,15:55,+263 78 524 8595,Think that is the elephant in the room currently at man united
2020-06-07,15:55,+263 77 621 1237,Uri webhora iwewe
2020-06-07,15:55,+27 84 378 3617,Fred is good but is not Matic. He has to imporve stability then he can be the guy for that position and better than Kante by far
2020-06-07,15:56,+27 81 049 6422,Everything about united is Bruno
2020-06-07,15:56,+27 84 378 3617,You can only here United fans gassin up kids like they are shit. That garner is not even on Gilmores level
2020-06-07,15:57,+27 81 049 6422,Are you serious?
2020-06-07,15:57,+27 84 378 3617,Disrespect for Pog and Matic
2020-06-07,15:57,+263 78 524 8595,"Youth Captain,  he is being tipped to fill in the DLink position"
2020-06-07,15:57,+27 81 049 6422,Pog was injured
2020-06-07,15:57,+27 84 378 3617,"Don take this too serious now, just wait for it"
2020-06-07,15:58,+27 81 049 6422,You cab not credit him for ur form
2020-06-07,15:58,+263 78 524 8595,Personally i think Garner is a good player and if given the chance he could be a first teamer without a doubt
2020-06-07,15:59,+27 84 378 3617,"Bruno is good, Pog is very important. Matic bring stability and assurance for the two to flourish"
2020-06-07,16:00,+27 84 378 3617,"We saw Gilmore, is he on that level?"
2020-06-07,16:00,+27 84 378 3617,"hakuna patichaita fill every position with youth, after Matic United should look for a CDM"
2020-06-07,16:01,+27 84 378 3617,"The kids agenda is trash, ndozvakauraya Arsenal"
2020-06-07,16:11,+263 78 524 8595,"Gilmore just got lucky becoz chelsea encountered injuries in the mid, however i believe if Garner is given a  chance he could surpus even Carrick, not only Garner they is also Levitt they are all good players that can match Gilmore if given a run of games"
2020-06-07,16:12,+263 78 524 8595,"The kids agenda if played nicely could do wonders, Class of 92"
2020-06-07,16:21,+27 84 378 3617,The game has moved gent s
2020-06-07,16:24,+263 78 524 8595,"Rashford, greenwood are products of the youth system, Pogba too even if he had to go to juventus and develop, we have Henderson soon to be our Number 1"
2020-06-07,16:26,+263 78 524 8595,If we can bring up these players it can help us save funds to buy worldclass players in other positions
2020-06-07,16:27,+27 84 378 3617,Its that neccessary ? How many players were from the class of 92?
2020-06-07,16:28,+263 78 524 8595,6 players
2020-06-07,16:29,Doc,It has started to work for Chelsea and l agree also that it has to be coupled with buying to balance the squad with marquee signings
2020-06-07,16:29,+27 81 049 6422,"You guys are talking about players who don't even have 10 epl games in them, and you comparing them Carrick 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣"

2020-06-07,16:29,+27 84 378 3617,Do you think we gonnna make 6 players again?
2020-06-07,16:30,+263 78 524 8595,We talking about potential cde relax and you are few to add your own opinion
2020-06-07,16:30,+27 84 378 3617,Potential is deciving
2020-06-07,16:32,+27 81 049 6422,"Barkley, Luke Shaw, Caroll, u name them, they had potential"
2020-06-07,16:32,+263 78 524 8595,"Rashford, Greenwood, Henderson, Williams if he manages to perform well but yahh i think we can"
2020-06-07,16:32,+27 81 049 6422,Especially when you talking about England youngsters
2020-06-07,16:33,+263 78 524 8595,Media aside i think England youngsters have come up real good.

2020-06-07,16:36,+27 81 049 6422,"Ravl Morrison, was picked to be the one of the best ever  youngster to come thru at United after a handful of good games saka proceed with caution with English players"
2020-06-07,16:37,+27 81 049 6422,"Yea, as youngsters they are very good"
2020-06-07,16:39,+27 84 378 3617,Do we want to build English national team or win the EPL and Uefa??
2020-06-07,16:42,+263 78 524 8595,"Ravel Morrison even pogba anotaura kuti chaive chibaba changu but he was dropped because of the negative influence he was having outside, drugs ..gangs etc"
2020-06-07,16:42,Doc,Barkley arikutamba bhora... what do u want in football from scoring and assisting and defending well
2020-06-07,16:42,Doc,"You can't classify him with Shaw, when he is better than Fred, Milner, Chamberlain, Ceballos, Mctominay, Sigurdsson, Keita,"
2020-06-07,16:43,+27 84 378 3617,If you leave Fred out of this your point makes sense to me 😂
2020-06-07,16:44,+263 78 524 8595,"Bhora parakanakira is you do not need more than 5 games kuona kana player irihosho we made that mistake na welbeck, but atleast these players are scoring and performing well"
2020-06-07,16:45,+263 78 524 8595,No i m talking about the players we have
2020-06-07,16:45,Doc,Barkley is effective on both ends of the field...

2020-08-07,10:32,Doc,Do u know kuti we can be surprised what can come out of some people we are about to offload if we find them a leader on the pitch
2020-08-07,10:33,Doc,"Azpi leads himself well, but he cannot lead the defense ... he stays at his wing but he doesn't watch over the defense line and he doesn't lead the goalie."
2020-08-07,10:35,+263 77 541 9969,Being at the wing and being an attacking somebody means the kind of leadership needed to command the defense is missed most of the times.
2020-08-07,11:50,+263 78 524 8595,Yes the forward line is good but i will only start taking chelsea as a threat after you fix your defence

2020-10-07,08:30,+27 84 378 3617,I don't mean time for him to play how you guys want or prefer.  The time he deserves is the time any other managers deserves when he get to a new broken club.
2020-10-07,08:32,+27 84 378 3617,"He has gotten similar points with Chelsea and Arsenal every since he started at Tottenham but does not play the way you guys want, hence the agenda you have.  Mou needs time."
2020-10-07,08:36,+263 71 657 5991,fair analysis..kwete kungotaura pasina backing yema facts
2020-10-07,08:46,Doc,"Tottenham is still not convincing in their game, be sure that next season the best they can get is 6th.  Tottenham like Arsenal has a problem rooting beyond football...  All the players want away an non of them will renew their deas because the way the club is run. It's one dimensional to belive that Pochettino's dismissal was because he was a bad manager. No, the club had a rigid board and nothing can a manager do to change that"
2020-10-07,08:47,Doc,Then on Mourinho his type of football needs reinvention otherwise he has expired
2020-10-07,08:48,+27 81 049 6422,"That's fair.. But having watched yesterday's game, it's really disappointing, I'd expect his progress to be slow as you say, losing to Sheffield United, not so bad they are playing very well this season but failing to have a shot on goal the whole second half against an almost relagated Burnemouth? Even almost losing the game, their performance yesterday was very very bad. It's worrying"
2020-10-07,08:48,+263 78 524 8595,Veduwe ku man utd mourinho uyu takamuona apana zviripo
2020-10-07,08:48,Doc,"We will see that next season...  Players no longer need bosses, even in the workplace today, if you want any project that you're leading to fail, just hire millennials and be a boss and see how the project will degenerate into a failed project"
2020-10-07,08:49,Rairo,"Bournemouth has lost 7 of its last 8 and we put 5 past them and Mourinho couldn't get his team to get a single shot on target, he's done out here."
2020-10-07,08:49,Doc,"Talent no longer needs to be treated the Mourinho style of leadership that dictates to players and shames players in press conferences ... dressing room rants, all that totalitarianism"
2020-10-07,08:51,+27 81 049 6422,@27843783617 what do you say about that?
2020-10-07,08:56,Doc,"That goes down to the type of football play now.  We saw what Poch did with the same squad, he played a balances attacking brand of football  But what's ths thing of n out getting a single shot on target with World's most compete number 9 *(Harry Kane)*  Son, Alli, Moura, Lamela  But they are on squeezed into a defense mindset"
2020-10-07,08:56,+263 78 524 8595,"Brain dze bhora mourinho haana,tactical awareness apachina"
2020-10-07,08:58,Rairo,"Exactly no excuses when you have Harry Kane lol he's an on sight shooter like Ronaldo.  Also I remember him convincing half the fanbase that Labile and Tony can't play ball, same way he's doing to Ndombele"
2020-10-07,08:58,Doc,My Grandmother could Manager Tottenham and still get a shot on target
2020-10-07,08:58,Doc,Harry Kane doesn't even need to be in the box...  The dude shoots
2020-10-07,09:00,Doc,"How do you tell me kuti you have 5 substitutes at your disposal but hey, not a single shot on target... what did u tell your players over half time when they registered no short on target,  Of course he shouted and screamed he did everything except motivate the team and get their creativity flowing"
2020-10-07,09:02,Doc,Again you had that water break but u still couldnt get then to at least shoot havo ka1. Bhora rake rakuda kuchinjwa asi vanhu sekutsigira kwavanoita zanu uchanzwa vachimutsigira ipapa
2020-10-07,09:03,Doc,"Same old fuck ups, he did with KDB, Costa, at Chelsea"
2020-10-07,09:04,+27 81 049 6422,"He does need time with the team for sure, but they manner in which the drew yesterday kana Masvori yaisadaro"
2020-10-07,09:04,Doc,"The team doesn't need much, he himself needs to change his philosophy"
2020-10-07,09:06,Rairo,"Gudyie time yekudii? Vanopuwa time vanhu vanoratidza direction, at least tell me what style of play he's trying to implement?"
2020-10-07,09:08,+27 81 049 6422,"I mean tingati kudii, as disappointing as it is, it's too soon to fire him and look at Ole, he is thriving now having had a difficult start"
2020-10-07,09:11,Doc,Ole had 12 straight wins in last season
2020-10-07,09:11,Rairo,Ole did not have a difficult start lol he broke record for consecutive wins
2020-10-07,09:11,Rairo,Exactly
2020-10-07,09:12,Doc,That was an emphatic statement of intent which earned him a chance and money to spend and made him to be appointed permanently
2020-10-07,09:13,Rairo,And he passes most tactical battles home or away
2020-10-07,09:14,+27 81 049 6422,"Oh yes, yea"
2020-10-07,09:15,+27 81 049 6422,"Especially in big matches, Pep knows him well 😂😂"

2020-10-07,09:20,Gerry,"Arrogance, arrogance.. Pana Jose chiripo inharo chaidzo, kuoma msoro. Mou doesn't want to change his tactics. I think he can but he doesn't want to. He is holding on to his identity, you know, tha  ""park the bus and hit on the break"" game plan. He's simply an egomaniac. He should just be a defensive coach at arsenal  at this point. Anotyora mamumbo avapfana vaya. Hanai Moura ikozvino."
2020-10-07,09:22,Gerry,"Hell, we thought Shaw sucked ball  under him. Now I pick him over Robertson any day."
2020-10-07,09:26,Doc,Shaw inini ndakaramba kuti haagone...  Kwedu he chased Filipe Luiz like a dog
2020-10-07,09:27,+263 78 524 8595,Williams could be better than shaw
2020-10-07,09:30,Gerry,"Hahahaha well ya, he had momentary genius. But he was always contained at the left back. How many times did you see him make those 18 area runs from his box. He's a marvel to watch ikozvino mpfana uya"
2020-10-07,11:00,Rairo,True the ego is just to big for this current environment

2020-07-15,18:19,+27 81 049 6422,"He actually saved Chelsea last night, could have been a disaster"
2020-07-15,18:20,Rairo,Exactly
2020-07-15,18:22,+27 81 049 6422,"That's how vulnerable and nervous Chelsea are, managed a goal against an already relegated Norwich"
2020-07-15,18:50,Doc,In all our silverware years we have an inform number 9
2020-07-15,18:51,Rairo,Lol what's your point?
2020-07-15,18:51,Doc,Giroud is not at the level of Drogba Costa Crespo Anelka
2020-07-15,18:51,Rairo,"Agreed he is Giroud, appreciate him for what he is don't put him down for what he's not."
2020-07-15,18:52,+27 81 049 6422,"He is the best that you have, he might not be at the level of those number  9s, but at Chelsea, at the moment, he is efficient, appreciate him"

2020-07-16,06:16,+27 81 049 6422,"If we don't buy a 10 and have another dimension or reinvent out game, we will struggle to make top four next season."

2020-07-18,11:19,Doc,Uyo he is a necessary buy
2020-07-18,11:31,Doc,Alcantra can give Liverpool attack a more direct approach and his creativity can make them unpredictable once again... they wont always need crosses and Tee offs
2020-07-18,12:20,Doc,This thing of Bundesliga stars desperate to join EPL clubs speaks volumes about  football in Germany
2020-07-18,12:47,+263 77 621 1237,Yeah yeah
2020-07-18,12:57,Doc,"I really want United to get Sancho and 2 other great signings, next season we need a blockbuster out there"
2020-07-18,12:58,Doc,Arsenal is still not serious so I have written them off from next season before even this season even ends
2020-07-18,12:59,Doc,City should sign a defense reinforcements and Chelsea too
2020-07-18,13:00,Doc,"If Leceister doesn't pump on some more bucks, they are going back to mid table"
2020-07-18,13:08,+27 81 049 6422,Getting Sancho will mean a lot less minutes for Greenwood and Daniel James
2020-07-18,13:08,+27 81 049 6422,United rather spend that 100 million on Koulibaly
2020-07-18,13:33,Doc,"Greenwood is good, he will start against Burnley, Brighton,  Leeds etc, when Sancho is rested for an upcoming big game, that attack has no depth one injury and everything goes south"
2020-07-18,13:34,Doc,"100 million for a defender during the corona affected market does make any sense, just like NAPOLI being fooled into geting 73million for Osimhen its robbery"
2020-07-18,13:34,Doc,even 90million for Havertz is too much
2020-07-18,13:37,+27 81 049 6422,"That's business.. in terms of the team needs, depth in attack and  a center back are crucial for United."
2020-07-18,13:37,Doc,"United needs a real number 9, to be flanked by Martial, Rashford and Sancho, and when he is rested or injured Martial can then play 9, otherwise over time u shall see that that team will struggle for goals"
2020-07-18,13:38,+27 81 049 6422,"Bro, could be but 6 months down the line, could be a bargain"
2020-07-18,13:39,Doc,"I would go for a cheaper centrehalf, 100 mil is too much, 45(Bissaka) + 85 (Maguire) + 40 (Shaw) + 100 (Koulibali) .... thats insane to invest in defense only"
2020-07-18,13:40,Doc,"i agree, he is a special tament and he has a massive resaleable value 5 years later when he is now a matured big player"
2020-07-18,13:41,+27 81 049 6422,"If they don't get a CB, chero vakatenga Sancho, they will just fight for top four and won't necessarily improve their performance"
2020-07-18,17:03,Rairo,"There are 4 trophies and risk to long term injuries, to compete on all fronts you need a good team A and team B."
2020-07-18,17:05,Doc,Greenwood will be like Odoi in the long run. He cant carry United's demands. Anopedzisira avengwa nema fans
2020-07-18,17:13,Rairo,Lol he's already better than what Chelsea fans think Odoi is.
2020-07-18,17:22,Doc,4 games dont determine bhora remunhu tsano

2020-07-18,17:25,Rairo,"He has played over 30 games and is 18 putting Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen numbers, Odoi with his 1 premier league goal is not on his level"
2020-07-18,17:25,Rairo,He has already made more than that this season
2020-07-18,17:26,Rairo,Greenwood has 15 goals lol how many 18 year olds ik the history of the Premier league have more?
2020-07-18,20:32,+263 78 524 8595,"Since rooney ,, greenwood is the only 18 year old that has scored more than 8 epl goals"
2020-07-18,20:33,Doc,I didn't know this
2020-07-18,20:34,Doc,Saka he is special

2020-07-18,21:30,+27 84 378 3617,It looks like Arteta learnt more from Mou than Pep.  Arsenal is SOLID for the past two games

2020-07-19,11:01,+27 81 049 6422,There is a better chance of Rodgers getting 3 points today than Chelsea getting 2 points in its remaining 2 fixtures
2020-07-19,11:03,+27 81 049 6422,"You are running away from the fact that, fixture list mairiziva pamaka dyisa ne Westham and Sheffield, and today, it's noy up to you anymore, you don't have the comfort to get the job done"

2020-07-19,17:18,Doc,Unless we want to use emotion analysis again

He has had to play as winger, box to box number 8, number 10. Hasnt taken much time injured and has had good discipline, it's his first PL season but the la d has been an asset thru and thru. He is the best Chelsea player based on this season alone."
2020-07-20,07:44,Doc,"If not him then the other consistant figure has been Captain Azpi, had a few bad games but has always been solid thru the season. Decisive blocks and tackles."

If I am to try and analyse how Chelsea played, there is really nothing much for the fans to be overly excited about besides the 3-1 result and playing in the final. Soccer quality was not up to par from both teams. But obviously United were CONFUSED."
2020-07-20,09:27,Doc,True
2020-07-20,09:28,Doc,Ole also did not do enough tactical homework as well

2020-07-20,09:33,+27 84 378 3617,Which has always been his biggest weakness.  Sad that is clear that the current form was due to player talent more than the coaches tactics.  Heart break incoming I sense.

2020-07-20,10:14,+27 84 378 3617,"You think this crop of players will get a result?  The challenge is that there are no tactics to follow, so our performance is directly linked to player talent.  You saw what happened when this crop of players played against Nowich? You saw what happened when Pog was not in the starting line up against Tottenham? You saw how things went when Pog and Bruno were subbed against Southampton?  We rely on player talent, players ""expressing themselves "" whatever that is.  Hakuna imba inobudirira isina mutemo"
2020-07-20,11:05,Gerry,"I agree, there is a big drop off between the first team and the reserves, a serious one. You can't change that now, what ole had to do to rest the first team and prioritize the league games. Lose with a crapy reserve team and protect the first team, mentally. Even Mou did it, he gets hummered by Arsenal by introducing the likes of Angel Gomes, Chong, etc....and wins the Europa.

2020-07-21,12:43,Doc,But if u are in your right mind what's easy to play Leceister in a winner takes all game...  Than to play Wolves at Home with a one point lead on 2 teams that are playing each other...  I m asking u to think there

2020-07-21,12:51,Tavonga,Kkk. Im confident Westham do not have the required fitness levels of Soton and Chelsea to press us high up the pitch and force turnovers. Moyes likes to sit back and hit on the break. And once we have them pinned in their 18yard box Bruno will work his magic
2020-07-21,12:53,Doc,We all saw how tired Mr Bruno is... Hameno pamwe achamuka chipembenene mangwana
2020-07-21,12:53,Doc,But United has lost form where it matters most
2020-07-21,12:56,Tavonga,Maybe. But lm more worried about our defence. That performance against Chelsea could possibly have scarred them. Will they be able to handle the physicality of Antonio. He will most likely target Lindelof. Bully him into submission
2020-07-21,13:01,+27 84 378 3617,"They have never been good, not personal per se, but our defensive transition is POOR. That is down to coaching. Any half decent team can exploit that sadly"
2020-07-21,13:02,+27 84 378 3617,*personnel
2020-07-21,13:02,Tavonga,But we have the second best defence in the league. Conceded 35goals chete. How do you explain that
2020-07-21,13:10,Doc,Not the best defence but cant be compared with weak defences like Chelsea's
2020-07-21,13:11,Tavonga,The quality of personnel is not that Difference.
2020-07-21,13:11,Doc,United's defence is almost there
2020-07-21,13:12,Tavonga,Problem lay with yr Deployment of Jorginho as the deepest lying midff
2020-07-21,13:12,Tavonga,Midfielder
2020-07-21,13:12,Doc,"With a tough man like Kante in front of them, and a no nonsense man to play with Maguire its done"
2020-07-21,13:12,+27 84 378 3617,"Okay, let me explain  You remember the ""good"" run which started after we had injuries to, Pog, and Rashy? That time when Matic wasn't playing. Our defence was bad. Then because of our frailty, we resorted to a back 5 and full on depended on beating teams on the break. We defended like Burnley and it worked.  Then after the break we played relatively bad teams, we had better quality upfront. Our attack gave a defensive compnent. Teams were struggling to deal with that.  But it takes a few games to be found out. For the past 8 games we have let in a goal every game at average. That's does not spell ""the best defence"".  In summary, I accredit our defence record to the type of play we did when our team was weakest in terms of personnel because we had no option. When we try to play in a balanced way, teams WILL score."
2020-07-21,13:15,+27 84 378 3617,"I credit Chelsea for playing in a balanced way despite of their defensive frailties and are still ahead of United. (Although it's not gonna be for long)😁  If chele gets quality in defence, United will be their meal any day"
2020-07-21,13:17,Tavonga,Makes sense
2020-07-21,13:21,Tavonga,In terms of quality this season has been the worst in recent memory. 66points would have got you 7th place last season. This season its good for 3rd. Credit to the smaller teams l guess.
2020-07-21,13:23,+27 84 378 3617,"Maybe, but also big teams were out of order.  But next season I see normality restored."

2020-07-21,14:22,+27 81 049 6422,"The stats don't reflect the true picture of that defense, they could as well have the best defense but Magaya and Lindelof won't take any team to the title"

Nationality  had to be a thing, because we all know how mediocre English players can be and how overrrated and over priced they are.

2020-07-22,21:01,Doc,The team is over dependent on Fernandes for its creativity...  I hope Rodgers will not punish United for that.  The oan is tired and there is too much responsibility on his shoulders.  *Objectively*  I'm thinking Sunday will be really hard for United..

2020-07-23,07:04,+263 71 657 5991,"Ma supporter ebhora are funny..Analysis dzinowanzwa ma feelings than objectivity. Now the narrative by Chelsea supporters is we fought back well and against the Champions. Why did you have to fight back in the first instance when you all started at 0-0? So its supposed to be ok because Liverpool are now the Champions? You forget everyone else in the League played against Liverpool and when they lost you made fun of them. Because it ended 5-3, you are somehow left feeling better than someone beaten 2-0 or 3-1 ?  Haaaa thats some warped analysis"
2020-07-23,07:08,+263 78 524 8595,"Ini hangu ndoda kunzwisisa why Maguire achishorwa when his defence has only conceded 36 goals, 4 more than Liverpool and 2 more than city .  Ndatenda"

2020-07-23,08:53,Tavonga,Thank you
2020-07-23,08:56,+27 81 049 6422,Its the team's defensive performance and type of play that United has adopted that has seen them concede those goals
2020-07-23,08:56,+27 81 049 6422,But Maguire has individually been very poor
2020-07-23,08:58,Tavonga,What type of play. We average 55% possession every game. Roughly that of Chelsea
2020-07-23,08:58,Tavonga,How so. Remember he has played every minute of premier League football
2020-07-23,09:02,+27 81 049 6422,"He is the most expensive defender in the league, you would have expected him to have an impact, sort of the one VVD had at Liverpool. But not even close, as much as United has the third best defense, his individual stats, clearances, blocks etc they are not even in the top 5 and United only has 12 clean sheets with a game left"
2020-07-23,09:09,Rairo,"Neni ndodawo kunzwisisa Chelsea has conceded over 50 goals, 50! but their fans are loudest mouths when it comes to Maguire."
2020-07-23,09:10,Rairo,Liverpool's defence and ours are not that much different this season.

2020-07-23,09:16,+27 81 049 6422,Liverpool dont get attacked as much as United
2020-07-23,09:17,Doc,Those arewqrong stats; he scored an own goal on Sunday takatarisa but his errors leading to goal still say zero
2020-07-23,09:17,Rairo,Nothing special about that
2020-07-23,09:17,Rairo,Read the chart again without feelings
2020-07-23,09:17,+263 71 657 5991,what do you attribute that to ?
2020-07-23,09:19,Doc,So if we want to judge a player we exclude other games to make them look better?
2020-07-23,09:20,Ticha Flombo,So maguire aint a fraud?
2020-07-23,09:20,Rairo,Those are premier league stats
2020-07-23,09:20,Rairo,He maybe but you aren't qualified to speak on it
2020-07-23,09:21,Doc,Maguire is GOOD in my opinion but he does not make VVD class
2020-07-23,09:21,Doc,"I think he makes a good EPL CB, akazowana a partner he can even show more quality"
2020-07-23,09:21,Rairo,Agreed

2020-07-23,09:22,+27 81 049 6422,The team's overall performance
2020-07-23,09:23,Doc,The more important attributes of VVD like his leadership and his ability to be a player maker from the back are not numberical
2020-07-23,09:23,Rairo,"Ask the top managers they have an analytics team, in every sport. Klopp once joked if he told you the real reason he doesn't like direct corner you will laugh"
2020-07-23,09:27,+27 81 049 6422,What defensive qualities does Maguire have? Anoitei?
2020-07-23,09:28,Doc,"He is a leader from the back but not o the level of VVD , Ramos, John Terry"
2020-07-23,09:28,+263 71 657 5991,And he has no meaningful/significant contribution to that performance?
2020-07-23,09:29,+263 71 657 5991,I thank you
2020-07-23,09:30,Doc,"Last night he had a descent game, WHU could have broken thru behind Williams, but he neutralized much of that"

2020-07-23,09:33,+27 81 049 6422,"Fiction, each time crosses came into the box Westham players got a head on it"
2020-07-23,09:33,+27 81 049 6422,Twice Antonio beat the same Maguire to the ball
2020-07-23,09:33,+263 71 657 5991,He organizes the back line well
2020-07-23,09:34,Rairo,No one in the league is better than him at headed clearances for example
2020-07-23,09:34,+263 71 657 5991,and the cover he provided each William's got beaten or dribbled past

2020-07-23,09:45,+263 78 524 8595,"Maguire had a decent season, our problem from the back mainly came from poor performances from De Grand and our fullbacks inability to make a spark on the flank"

2020-07-24,08:39,Doc,Although I feel his struggles have been increased also by a bad defense
2020-07-24,08:39,Doc,His stats under other managers were alright
2020-07-24,08:39,Doc,If I were Lampard I would buy him competition
2020-07-24,08:40,+27 84 378 3617,Eh 😂  Kepa here ?
2020-07-24,08:40,Doc,And strengthen the defense then akazotadza ipapo ndamupa demo
2020-07-24,08:40,Doc,Lampard has had I think Chelsea's worst defensive record in the past 15 years
2020-07-24,08:41,Doc,Kepa under Conte had a great season
2020-07-24,08:41,Doc,Kepa under Sarri was not too bad
2020-07-24,08:41,+27 84 378 3617,"Musadaro varume😂😂  Uya I still have a lil hope for him if the buffs up a bit, but ndiye type yana Cassilissen, good goalie but not quite at the guest level. No completion can save him"
2020-07-24,08:44,Doc,"He needs a defense, He needs a leader in front of him.  U see what VVD does, Allison only faces the shots he has to face. And he controls the goalie. He works as a link between play and the goalie.  That's what John Terry did for Cech.  Although I still question Kepa even with a great defense. He is too short for a Goalie... the man's stature and his concentration is not great"
2020-07-24,08:45,+27 84 378 3617,"Conte was just a defensive coach, with good defensive drills (Lampards problem at the moment). His performances were down to the setup."
2020-07-24,08:46,Doc,Sarri non of the 2
2020-07-24,08:46,Doc,He was in for ball possession
2020-07-24,08:46,+27 84 378 3617,Stature ya Kepa for me is the greatest concern.  He is decent but haaa no I can't see him making it under Lampards type of play.
2020-07-24,08:46,Doc,I thank Sarri for revolutionizing Chelsea's football
2020-07-24,08:47,Doc,Surely... his chances are slim
2020-07-24,08:47,Doc,I fancy Onana
2020-07-24,08:47,+27 84 378 3617,Sarri is a confused man.
2020-07-24,08:47,+27 84 378 3617,A serious team would get him pronto
2020-07-24,08:52,Doc,His unwillingness to be flexible and adapt to opponents and think outside the box is his biggest problem. We thank Juve for getting him out of our way
2020-07-24,09:32,+263 71 758 4509,Decent for an unambitious club
2020-07-24,10:21,Rairo,He's the Tika Taka Moyes
2020-07-24,10:21,Rairo,"""Sarriball"" is trash"
2020-07-24,10:27,Doc,I agree
2020-07-24,10:27,Doc,Asi akabatsira Chelsea
2020-07-24,10:28,Doc,Honestly Lampard built on Sarri going forward
2020-07-24,10:28,Doc,Sarri was the first manager to introduce proper short passing and real building from the back at Chelsea
2020-07-24,10:29,Doc,Lampard arrived to a squad that had been disciplined to stop and pass and be always a unit when he got to Chelsea
2020-07-24,10:30,Rairo,Lol manje not with that back line it won't work
2020-07-24,10:31,Rairo,He needs to upgrade all of it how can Azpilicueta still be the best defender after all these years?
2020-07-24,10:37,Doc,Short passing from the back works
2020-07-24,10:37,Doc,That's what everyone is doing
2020-07-24,10:37,Rairo,With good players yes
2020-07-24,10:37,Rairo,Conte did with Inter in 6 months
2020-07-24,10:38,Doc,Chelsea is second to City only in that
2020-07-24,10:38,Doc,"No, Conte played it long"
2020-07-24,10:38,Rairo,Liverpool is way better than you at that
2020-07-24,10:38,Rairo,Inter
2020-07-24,10:38,Doc,Not at Chelsea
2020-07-24,10:38,Rairo,I'm saying when you have the players for it
2020-07-24,10:38,Doc,J5 remains the king at that
2020-07-24,10:39,Rairo,Ndiani uyu?
2020-07-24,10:39,Doc,Chelsea is better than Liverpool ipapo
2020-07-24,10:39,Doc,Go check stats
2020-07-24,10:39,Rairo,"No they are not, Liverpool just have more variety to the game"
2020-07-24,10:40,Doc,Jorginho has by far the most passes in own half per game in PL stats
2020-07-24,10:41,Doc,"What are we saying here, Liverpool are a way better side, I m simply talking of stopping and p la ying own half passes. Chelsea was disciplined by Sarri here"
2020-07-24,10:43,Rairo,"That's pretty useless metric, for example City can attack directly with Ederson they will be no need for Rodri/Gundogan to receive the ball, Liverpool can also do the same with Trent, there will no need to give henderson/fabinho. Chelsea do not have passers as good as Ederson, Zinchenko, Trent, Robertson at the back that's why they give it to Jorginho most of the time"
2020-07-24,10:44,+27 81 049 6422,"Your defensive record is the worst in 19 years, how can be better than Liverpool at anything regarding starting at the back?"
2020-07-24,10:45,Rairo,Exactly Gomez is the worst passer in Liverpool's backline at Chelsea's backline they will call him Xavi 😂
2020-07-24,10:50,Doc,Kepa Arizabalaga is the goalie with the most foot touches in the last 2 seasons in the PL. And he is the only Goalkeeper who has 0 foot mistakes. He is the world's best goalkeeper on foot stats. Asi his hands suck we agree
2020-07-24,10:50,Doc,Iwewe urikutaura ne emotion that's the problem we are having
2020-07-24,10:51,Doc,"I'm not saying own half passes work, NO... I supports passage of play ye Liverpool"
2020-07-24,10:51,Doc,Ne City
2020-07-24,10:52,Doc,Ndiro bhora manje kwete Jorginho anoswera achipira Kepa
2020-07-24,10:52,Rairo,"A blind Ederson is better than him, he has the most touches because the ball spends a lot of time in your own half"
2020-07-24,10:52,Doc,Yes I agree with all that.
2020-07-24,10:52,Rairo,Guardiola will sell the whole squad if you play like that
2020-07-24,10:53,Doc,But Kepa Arizabalaga patsoka akaipa
2020-07-24,10:53,+27 81 049 6422,"Doesn't count if they are short passes, probably in your own 18 yard box, since they insist playing from the back"
2020-07-24,10:53,Doc,He is reliable on back passes and all
2020-07-24,10:53,Doc,Kepa anosimudza musoro
2020-07-24,10:53,+27 81 049 6422,Lol

2020-07-24,10:55,+27 81 049 6422,"Take a screen shot, coz ukunyepa iwe"
2020-07-24,10:56,Doc,"The issue we are arguing about is, did Sarri change football at Chelsea? Yes or No?  I dont like Sarri I dont like Sarriball  But he changed Chelsea"
2020-07-24,10:58,Rairo,<Media omitted>
2020-07-24,10:58,Doc,145 is the most passes let agree
2020-07-24,10:59,+27 81 049 6422,Agreed
2020-07-24,10:59,Doc,So what then?
2020-07-24,11:00,Doc,Sarri taught Chelsea to stop and pass

2020-07-24,11:01,Doc,Lloris bhora pamakumbo havatomupire he panics
2020-07-24,11:01,Rairo,"How many chances has Kepa created? Mistakes arise from playing high risk football, Chelsea just play at the back for the sake of it"
2020-07-24,11:02,Doc,I agree
2020-07-24,11:02,Doc,I'm not arguing with all that
2020-07-24,11:02,Doc,Inini I was only saying Sarri akabatsira Chelsea
2020-07-24,11:02,Doc,I never said I fancy all that
2020-07-24,11:02,+27 81 049 6422,There is no better stat than goals conceded
2020-07-24,11:03,Doc,Handipenge kaini to compare Chelsea with City and Liverpool
2020-07-24,11:03,Doc,Are u even aware of the direction of this discussion
2020-07-24,11:03,Rairo,"Well I'm saying Sarriball hapana because the purpose of ""building"" from the back is to build attacks."
2020-07-24,11:03,Doc,I agree futi

2020-07-24,11:05,Doc,"Sarri akabatsira zvakanyanya, Chelsea taingomirira kumhanya mberi kana tarova zibhora zihombe from the back kunge and George Shaya"
2020-07-24,11:06,+27 81 049 6422,Building from the back is not for the personnel you have at Chelsea currently
2020-07-24,11:07,Doc,Hapana aramba zvese izvozvo
2020-07-24,11:07,Doc,Inini I only said Sarri akabatsira transition

2020-07-24,13:17,Rairo,Mane was better
2020-07-24,13:18,Doc,Haaaaaa inini I'm not even surprised I knew kuti Henderson was taking it
2020-07-24,13:18,Rairo,These journalist need their votes revoked from these awards
2020-07-24,13:19,Doc,"Mane and Henderson are just like Hazard and Kante   They gave Kante chimuti, even though vanhu vaiti Eden"

2020-07-26,21:23,Doc,"Haaaaaa Werner, Pulisic Ziyech, Havertz, Mount hmmm how sharp do you want a team to be.  Having Abraham, Giroud, Odoi, Loftus Cheek of the bench"
2020-07-26,21:29,Gerry,You are ready to bench Abhurahama and play Werner right away next season
2020-07-26,21:30,Doc,No
2020-07-26,21:31,Doc,All the new guys will fight their way in like what Pulisic did

2020-07-26,22:00,Ticha Flombo,Abraham was bein benched kaa already
2020-07-26,22:08,Doc,"It's because Giroud had form, and it didnt make sense to play Tammy who wasnt as sharp as he was at the beginning of the season"
2020-07-26,22:08,Doc,But Tammy will pick form again and we all know his capabilities
2020-07-27,08:05,Rairo,The new signings aren't getting benched lol team ikarohwa varipabench ma1

2020-07-27,10:37,Doc,They need to adapt and the team needs to adapt to them
2020-07-27,10:38,Rairo,Well since you are getting chucked out of Europe next week it gives you time to integrate them. This isn't January.

I could go on Man City (Hughes to Mancini, Mancinj Season by Season) Guardiola at City etc  Or further back Chelsea in the Abramovic era.  You're talking as if Lampard's Chelsea is Sir Alex Ferguson's united it's not, there is need of a whole sale change.  You're ta"

2020-07-27,11:12,Doc,"Transition has nothing to do with success and failure,  Let alone the mass shake up at Chelsea...  You cant have 5 new players ka1, you'll see what I'm saying as the season starts, they will grow into the team"
2020-07-27,11:12,Doc,English football harisi bhero
2020-07-27,11:13,Rairo,It has everything to do with success and failure spending big and not winning is the best way to get sacked in the premier league
2020-07-27,11:14,Rairo,"Chelsea right now has no base, it's like starting from scratch"
2020-07-27,11:14,+27 81 049 6422,"It's just that this year, there won't be much of a pre season, but ideally a new keeper , a CB, Werner and possibly Ziyech will definitely start next season"
2020-07-27,11:15,+27 81 049 6422,"4 new players will and can go straight into that team, no issues at all"
2020-07-27,11:15,Rairo,"You can't look back at this season and say you like the direction it's going, there is a need for a new direction."

2020-07-27,11:17,Rairo,I haven't seen Havertz play I wouldn't know but starting over Mount is a pretty low bar
2020-07-27,11:17,+27 81 049 6422,"CB, sha with what you have you can't afford to play with those CBs if Lampard is really serious about winning the league"

2020-07-27,11:18,Rairo,"He doesn't get it over the last 3 season to win the league you needed at least 98 points, Chelsea is 30 points or 10 wins away from that"

2020-07-27,11:22,Rairo,"Those not with the program should get binned, this is not an issue at any traditional big club, for Galactico V2 Real Madrid binned Sneijder, Robben, Raul, Guti.  Pep chucked out Ronaldinho and Deco then Etoo and Yaya.  I promise you these players at that point are each better than what Chelsea have right now. Lampard should not have sleepless nights about getting rid of Willian or Rudiger"

2020-07-27,11:34,Doc,"Andreas Vias Boas tried all you're saying at Chelsea  He failed.  Change management inoda intelligence, you have to be a politician in the dressing room.  You dont have to be direct in your approach and say ...  Hey Drogba, fuck off I have bought my Sturridge, ayehwa.  That's when Terry will let Van Persie score a Hatrick because u want his guy out"
2020-07-27,11:37,+27 81 049 6422,"You are emphasizing squad harmony, which i agree with entirely, but all the CBs need recycling.

2020-07-27,11:42,Doc,"His transfers won us the UCL (Mata, Cahill,"
2020-07-27,11:42,Rairo,At that point he wasn't which makes it not a good example
2020-07-27,11:42,Doc,"He was a radical, he lacked patience ... aimhanya, he lacked people skills"
2020-07-27,11:44,Rairo,"Lampard is yet to achieve what previous managers and he maybe sacked with nothing to show for it. This dressing is the weakest on in years, no big personalities or Abramovic favourites it's a poor excuse."
2020-07-27,11:45,Doc,He was a good tactician kubva kare that was what made him visible early in his career as well... he simply was bad with people
2020-07-27,11:46,Doc,Frank has taken a squad yekuti most managers and football analyst in Europe had said the best we could do this season was number 8

2020-07-27,11:47,Doc,"But Lampard did well, if u analyse with the mind not the heart you'll know that Frank is a great leader"
2020-07-27,11:48,+27 81 049 6422,"You were the 4th best team, more to do with the rest of the teams doing poorly than Lampard or Chelsea's squad, but credit to him for pushing this team"
2020-07-27,11:48,+27 81 049 6422,He did well. I agree with you on that
2020-07-27,11:48,Doc,"He beat all top teams in at least one game in his Maiden PL season..  Out classing the likes of Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti"
2020-07-27,11:48,Rairo,He gave up 10 points over Ole
2020-07-27,11:49,Rairo,He got turned around by Ole
2020-07-27,11:49,+27 81 049 6422,There was no one else competing this season
2020-07-27,11:50,Rairo,Yes Liverpool were coasting City got an easy second Chelsea and Leicester should have been comfortable 3rd and 4th.
2020-07-27,11:51,+27 81 049 6422,And Frank had an experienced squad too
2020-07-27,11:51,Doc,"We accept all that,  Ole spent 130 mil  Ole was a PL manager before  Ole was with the same team he had last season  And I'm not saying Lampard is better than Ole, I'm saying Lampard did a great job, if u use the mind, but u use the heart thats the problem"
2020-07-27,11:51,Rairo,Ole sold his 70 million pound striker and didn't replace him
2020-07-27,11:51,+27 81 049 6422,6 wins on the last 22 games just shows you how poor United and Chelsea were this season to have till the last game to be within range of Leicester
2020-07-27,11:52,Rairo,Very poor
2020-07-27,11:52,+27 81 049 6422,Intergrated Greenwood into the team.
2020-07-27,11:52,Rairo,Aka good management
2020-07-27,11:52,Doc,"Abraham, Pulisic and Mount being with them 70% of Lampard's PL goals and assists, how experienced are they??"

2020-07-27,11:55,Doc,You spoke of experience and I'm saying these boys we nobody when the season started... but Lampard worked well

2020-07-27,11:58,Doc,"Lampard did well thats all,"
2020-07-27,11:59,Doc,"And check how these young talents are choosing Chelsea of bigger clubs, it's a pointer of the leadership ya Frank."

2020-07-27,12:01,+27 81 049 6422,True
2020-07-27,12:02,Rairo,What does he do better than Mane for example?
2020-07-27,12:04,Tavonga,Hazard akaoma boys. Not so much now but Hazard wedu uya uya no one came close mu league.
2020-07-27,12:05,Rairo,"Chelsea fans were just loud, where is his champions league pedigree?"
2020-07-27,12:05,Doc,Thank you for being objective  @263777414925 uses his heart a lot
2020-07-27,12:05,Rairo,Ndati one technical thing he does better than Mane?
2020-07-27,12:06,Tavonga,Hazard in full flow was a joy to watch. Too bad injuries cost him much this season
2020-07-27,12:06,Doc,"Hmmmmm Hazard akomana kaaa, haiwa haiwa can we argue about thats guys"
2020-07-27,12:06,Tavonga,Dribbling
2020-07-27,12:06,Tavonga,Far better dribbler than Mane
2020-07-27,12:06,Doc,Hazard and Mane are not in the same talent class...
2020-07-27,12:06,Rairo,"It's arguable, most of the dribbles are pointless"
2020-07-27,12:07,Doc,Hazard is just born for the game
2020-07-27,12:07,Rairo,Here is what I mean when I say Chelsea fans are loud
2020-07-27,12:07,Doc,Haaaaaa u picked on the wrong one today
2020-07-27,12:07,Rairo,"Champions league akaitei, no wonder he's struggling in La Liga"
2020-07-27,12:08,Doc,Hmmmmm Hazard saka akatengwa ne Madrid because of fans noise here?
2020-07-27,12:08,Rairo,Madrid inoda glitz

2020-07-27,12:08,Rairo,But believe if he carries it on next season they will dump him
2020-07-27,12:08,Rairo,Havanonoki
2020-07-27,12:09,Tavonga,Hazard assisted more than Mane.
2020-07-27,12:10,Tavonga,He doesn't seem motivated. Turned up overweight beggining of the season
2020-07-27,12:10,Rairo,Per game?
2020-07-27,12:10,Tavonga,During the course of the whole season. Hazard leads on Chance creation per 90mins
2020-07-27,12:10,Doc,"Inini I dont care about what's happening to Madrid, isusu tirikutaura zvedu  zvepa Bridge apo, kuti we scored 62 PL goals and Hazard was involved as a scorer or ass is in 31 goals (50%)"
2020-07-27,12:11,Rairo,He's had amazing seasons yes but I'm talking on the whole
2020-07-27,12:12,Doc,Haaaaaa Hazard akomana kaa🤣🤣🤣
2020-07-27,12:12,Doc,Icho changa chiri chibaba
2020-07-27,12:12,Rairo,That says more about what he was surrounded by than himself
2020-07-27,12:12,Rairo,Champions League akatambei? You're ducking that question.
2020-07-27,12:13,Rairo,He's one of the greats but he's heralded more than the likes of Mane that's my problem
2020-07-27,12:14,Doc,Chelsea never acquired enough talent in his time to challenge for champions league
2020-07-27,12:18,Rairo,He should be imposing himself in those games he's had a lot of chances
2020-07-27,12:18,Rairo,Winning the cup itself is a different question
2020-07-27,12:20,Tavonga,Amana Fear factor yaive naHazard hamus kuiziva. And he delivered against the big teams. Consistently. Teams assigned man markers. Doubled up on him. It ddnt work.
2020-07-27,12:21,Doc,"Thanks Bhobha nekutaura usingaise moyo, guys chokwadi mubhora chakanaka, Hazard yaive shumba akomana"
2020-07-27,12:21,Tavonga,I believe last season yake he had about 15 assists. Mane had 5.
2020-07-27,12:22,Rairo,Mane also had 22 goals
2020-07-27,12:22,Tavonga,"Hazard leadsMane in every attacking aspect. Except mane won golden boot last season. But look at assists, dribbles. Dribbles attempted. Most fouled. Chances created."
2020-07-27,12:22,Doc,"15 goals, 16 assists"
2020-07-27,12:23,Tavonga,Thank you. 31 goal involvments
2020-07-27,12:23,Rairo,<Media omitted>
2020-07-27,12:23,Doc,Hazard aisava ne team chete...  Had he played for Liverpool u would have seen how much more he could do
2020-07-27,12:24,Rairo,He's at Madrid now
2020-07-27,12:24,Tavonga,Madrid z shit now
2020-07-27,12:24,Doc,Can we compared unplayed Hazard to Mane
2020-07-27,12:24,Rairo,They won the league with him scoring 1 goal lol
2020-07-27,12:25,Tavonga,Ramos z their second top goal scorer.
2020-07-27,12:25,Rairo,He's being outscored by a defender 🤣
2020-07-27,12:25,Tavonga,Ungaritamba wakaisirwa asensio paside pako iwe kkk
2020-07-27,12:25,+27 81 049 6422,Lol what are you saying Bhobby
2020-07-27,12:26,Rairo,If Mane wzs Brazilian or European dai vanhu vachipenga naye
2020-07-27,12:27,Rairo,Aubameyang too(scored 20+ goals in the last 5 seasons) do you know how insane that is?
2020-07-27,12:27,Tavonga,Madrid z shit now. I wonder how they won the league. Last 5 games l believe they won by the odd goal vapiwa ma penalties Ramos opedxa basa. Kusvika Verane azoty they do not control Var
2020-07-27,12:28,Tavonga,Aubumayeng z the real deal. Dude outscored Lewandosky kuGermany
2020-07-27,12:28,Rairo,They are good enough to win the league with little contribution from Hazard
2020-07-27,12:28,Tavonga,Amana hes not mu bracket ra Hazard. Hazardl rate him kunana Neymar
2020-07-27,12:28,Rairo,Neymar is at least a level above ita easy
2020-07-27,12:28,Tavonga,The title triumph was based on their defense. Zidane aiparker
2020-07-27,12:29,Tavonga,Above Hazard. U lie
2020-07-27,12:30,Rairo,Neymar kana imwe level futi pakati pavo pana Salah then kouya iye naMane
2020-07-27,12:31,Rairo,Benzema had no problem scoring or assisting
2020-07-27,12:32,Tavonga,Madrid scored 70 but conceded just 24
2020-07-27,12:32,Rairo,That's more than Chelsea scored last season
2020-07-27,12:32,Tavonga,From January Benz yanga yafa ma piston kkk
2020-07-27,12:33,Tavonga,The problems with Sarriball have been well documented
2020-07-27,12:33,Rairo,Hazard seemed to like Sarriball more than Zizou ball lol
2020-07-27,12:34,Tavonga,Zizou ball is just guys lets win at all cost. No discernable strategy. Thats why he will never convince people he has the tactical acumen to be considered a great coach
2020-07-27,12:35,Tavonga,And he was marginalising Bale for some reason. Gues it worked. But City will school them mu Etihad. And l support Madrid btw
2020-07-27,12:35,Rairo,"That's not true, I used to think so but his let's win strategy has purpose, his integration of casemiro and use of full backs is one such strategy"
2020-07-27,12:36,+27 81 049 6422,"Waisaona their games, efficiency at its best, they have the best defensive record in Europe. Goals were spread all around the team, and with VAR, its simple, it favours the teams that attack the most, since the restart Madrid did not lose a game, its one thing to win by an odd goal, but its also another to keep a clean sheet"
2020-07-27,12:36,+27 81 049 6422,"Madrid are on form and with how City's defense is looking, they could get knocked out in Uefa"
2020-07-27,12:37,Rairo,His use of a diamond with Isco as a facilitator is also an interesting idea
2020-07-27,12:37,Rairo,Will be a good game but I think City go through off their work in the first leg
2020-07-27,12:38,Tavonga,Fair assesment. But he adopts a cautious approach to games. And more often than not would rely on Vinucious for some magic. Isco is finished. Bale wasn't playing. Hazard was always injured. Modric does not have the legs anymore. Kroos has always been consistent
2020-07-27,12:38,+27 81 049 6422,"Yes, those two away goals will come in handy"
2020-07-27,12:39,+27 81 049 6422,"Zidane anotanha dzaanosvikira, period"
2020-07-27,12:39,+27 81 049 6422,"No arrogance and he has understood that Ronaldo, so he has adjusted the squad to its strengths"
2020-07-27,12:39,Rairo,His defence is not very good if exposed hence the cautious approach in fact Real Madrid has not had a good defence for over a decade. They win games by outscoring.
2020-07-27,12:40,Tavonga,So why sideline Bale? He's probably their best player Barring Hazard
2020-07-27,12:41,+27 81 049 6422,That approach is due to tactical adjustments to use the team's strengths to its optimum. 25 goals conceded
2020-07-27,12:42,Tavonga,True. I do not fancy Zidane. Never have. But whatever he does works so what do l know
2020-07-27,12:42,Rairo,The goals are spread out how many are clean sheets?
2020-07-27,12:43,Rairo,Ramos+1 can never be trusted to keep a clean sheet
2020-07-27,12:43,Rairo,Especially in the Champions league
2020-07-27,12:43,Tavonga,This description sounds like you describing Atletico Madrid. Not the Great Real Madrid
2020-07-27,12:44,Tavonga,Kkkk. Yaaa. Him and Pepe vaindispaka manje
2020-07-27,12:44,Rairo,I'm describing Real Madrid to a tee
2020-07-27,12:44,+27 81 049 6422,Thats just a personal issue probably nothing to do with Bale's ability but importantly he won the league without him
2020-07-27,12:45,Tavonga,Totenham should bring him back. His last swansong. Tt wld be interesting with him Son and Kane
2020-07-27,12:46,Rairo,"I think it was a miscalculation remember zvataurwa na @263772828867 paya about sports management, Zidane akatanga kubata Bale rough thinking he will sell him then the club failed to find a buyer, Bale ndobva aita revenge yake by refusing to leave"
2020-07-27,12:46,Doc,I still want Bale the Left Back
2020-07-27,12:46,Doc,In a 3 4 3 formation
2020-07-27,12:46,Tavonga,So there's something wrong u agree. Madrid have never been described as being a Solid team. They usually outscored their opponents. Remember Mourinho ana Mai Maria Ronaldo and Benzema scoring over a hundrrd league goals. Then there was the BBC era outscoring MSN
2020-07-27,12:47,Tavonga,Makes sense
2020-07-27,12:47,Rairo,His defensive awareness is lost by now unless he's highly motivated
2020-07-27,12:47,Rairo,If Mourinho had his way he would have sold that backline
2020-07-27,12:47,Tavonga,Hes a superstar now. Anoramba kutambiswa position yaAlonso or Victor Moses kkk
2020-07-27,12:47,Doc,🤣🤣🤣 True
2020-07-27,12:48,Doc,Akuzvinzwa sugar🤣🤣🤣
2020-07-27,12:48,Doc,Zidane has been a good man manager asi pana Bale zvaramba
2020-07-27,12:48,Rairo,Defence cost him the CL at Madrid
2020-07-27,12:49,Tavonga,"Bale once held a banner rakanzi Wales first, Golf Second, Madrid third."
2020-07-27,12:49,Tavonga,Not defense. Lewandoski. No defence could ever contain that guy
2020-07-27,12:49,+27 81 049 6422,Zidane is doing everything against the culture of Madrid. And he is getting results so its hard to  criticize him
2020-07-27,12:50,Rairo,I support him he's treating them the way they treated him from the coach to the fans.
2020-07-27,12:50,+27 81 049 6422,He never fancied Bale from the beginning
2020-07-27,12:50,Rairo,He's also a player + coach legend he has leverage
2020-07-27,12:50,Tavonga,Apo first season he was beast. Decisive strikes in Champ league and Copa de Rey.
2020-07-27,12:50,Rairo,Ranga rakaipa
2020-07-27,12:51,Tavonga,Sad he will not be fondly remembered in Madrid
2020-07-27,12:52,+27 81 049 6422,"Bale is stupid and his character is commendable, I'd bench him too"
2020-07-27,12:53,Tavonga,Madrid started it.
2020-07-27,12:54,+27 81 049 6422,Don't matter
2020-07-27,12:54,Rairo,A standard Mourinho defence would not concede 4 though also remember the Bayern games where he lost on penalties? Silly goals conceded
2020-07-27,12:54,Tavonga,After he had an injury they deemed ons too many pa second season. Then Neymar started coming into his own and they wondered why Bale wasn't pushing up a level
2020-07-27,12:54,Rairo,It matters
2020-07-27,12:55,Tavonga,Plus they question why Bale doesn't speak Spanish after all this time in Spain. Aguero doesn't speak English but he is beloved in Manchester
2020-07-27,12:56,+27 81 049 6422,He should have known it would end this way especially how they sold Ronaldo
2020-07-27,12:57,+27 81 049 6422,"Had he been not getting so many injuries and performing on the pitch, no one would care"
2020-07-27,12:57,Tavonga,The Madrid supporters booed Ronaldo on occasion. Ungrateful bastards
2020-07-27,12:57,Tavonga,He has always perfomed on the pitch
2020-07-27,12:57,+27 81 049 6422,And who is Bale??? 😂😂
2020-07-27,12:57,Tavonga,Kkkk. Waona manje
2020-07-27,12:58,+27 81 049 6422,He was getting injured left and right
2020-07-27,12:58,Tavonga,Bale should come to Tottenham. Messi to city. Plus the calibre of coaches in England.
2020-07-27,12:58,Tavonga,Twld b interesting
2020-07-27,12:59,+27 81 049 6422,"Both teams can't afford those players, let alone pay them"
2020-07-27,13:00,Tavonga,Man City can afford anyone. Especially after they successfully fended of zvima ban zvavaida kupiwa kk

2020-07-27,17:24,Doc,But he is the only one who had the teams correct but in the wrong order
2020-07-27,17:26,Rairo,I would give Karen Carney more credit even though she got 4th wrong she was measured. Top 2 was unquestionable after last season.

2020-07-27,17:42,Rairo,"Point is for me I don't see the reason of praising Ole for this season, it was the bare minimum he has a long way to go."
2020-07-27,17:43,Rairo,"Remember noise I said you made about Hazard, you're doing the same with Lampard he took over 3rd and finished 4th."
2020-07-27,17:43,Doc,I praise Lampard he did well
2020-07-27,17:43,Doc,"I think Ole did well too, he used all the players he bought"

2020-09-08,08:32,+263 77 621 1237,I always take notes from Klopp's approach. When he came to Liverpool our squad was full of shit and after 4 years he has turned the team into a world class team. Koeman at Everton tried bought too many players but akafa nekudyiwa not that the players were so bad but it takes time to build team chemistry

2020-09-08,08:45,+263 77 621 1237,Remember he has been a strong critique of the English fixtures that's why he would give priority to Major honours  rather than baba FA
2020-09-08,08:53,Rairo,My point is even with a trash team Klopp was tactically aware and his record in big games was impeccable you can't say the same with Lampard

2020-10-08,21:12,+263 78 524 8595,So are we saying a win rate of 45% is good?
2020-10-08,21:15,Doc,Relatively... *Yes* Only 2 teams are above that
2020-10-08,21:20,+263 78 524 8595,"Thats were we differ, 45% is not a good number to me, if they had played better they could have easily got into the top 4, mourinho is on that spot because of teams like Leicester and chelsea losing points otherwise he could have been lower than that"

2020-11-08,09:08,+263 71 657 5991,very good...I am Man Utd and I dont understand why we are wasting our time chasing Sancho..We have been there before and lost time trying to get Bale and at some point Rodriguez yet there are some real gems out there with less hype but exceptionally great players. Our scouting sucks
2020-11-08,09:11,+263 78 524 8595,Who can we sign though
2020-11-08,09:14,+263 71 657 5991,"In place of Sancho or generally? As a club, we appear like we get hints or info on who to sign through the media lol..Surely our scouts and Ole have their wishlist which I desperately want to believe does not only include players from the top Champions League clubs. To be fair though Ole has signed quite well and when I criticize our signings I am going 5 years or so back"
2020-11-08,09:15,+263 78 524 8595,In place of sancho
2020-11-08,09:16,+263 78 524 8595,Though our transfer team sucks i think its necessary we sign sancho
2020-11-08,09:17,+263 78 524 8595,We need a specialist Right winger and sancho currently is the best in that position
2020-11-08,09:19,+263 78 524 8595,"Greenwood could grow up to be better than both sancho and rashford but i dont think we need to rush him, and the team really needs depth"
2020-11-08,09:19,+263 78 524 8595,For me sancho is a no brainer
2020-11-08,09:19,+263 71 657 5991,I havent watched players in that position tbh although on face value I can already tell you that we will be getting an overpriced asset paye if we do. He is good but overhyped hake like a typical English player
2020-11-08,09:22,+263 71 657 5991,"And for this reason, I would gladly and seriously look at the 2nd and 3rd option on their list. That said I am not convinced that position should be our priority for this window..we do need a proper CDM. I would even look for a proper striker before I worry about the right wing"
2020-11-08,09:22,Doc,Sancho suits United and Ole type of play.  I'm concerned with the price only. But Sancho possesses flare that noone has at United.
2020-11-08,09:23,Doc,I however agree that the noise if it doesn't reap results munenge mamama
2020-11-08,09:23,+263 78 524 8595,"On sancho if you look at his stats he is not that typical english player were the media will be overhyping him, he really walks the talk, if haverts is worth 80 mil then sancho is above 100mil"
2020-11-08,09:24,Doc,"United should Jadon  If they dont get him, try to sign Sancho and if all that fails.  Then sign Jadon Sancho  Good bye"
2020-11-08,09:24,+263 77 621 1237,I am sure anyone who wants who wants to do business with United will bargain for more. Vanotongobhadhara Mari vanhu ava
2020-11-08,09:25,+263 71 657 5991,At the end of the day Woodward will sign the cheque. He will sign at the initial asking price futi. So all this drama is unnecessary and will serve to place a lot of pressure on the boy from the onset

Why on earth would you spend 110 million on an 18 year old?? In this current market?? United look like they scout via social media or based on what pundits say, they always go for big name players. They used to have the John Osheas, Darren Fletchers, even Young at his best, etc"
